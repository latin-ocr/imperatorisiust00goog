person has merely Detention, without the animus 3 he then determines
to hold lor himself exclusively3 the Detention is converted into Pos-
session (lor the analogous case of detention passing into dominium
see Title r. 44 supa). Where A has detention ol an object whichB
possesses (e. g. is heis B’slessee), and it is theu agreed that A shall
possess instead ol detain, Α becomes possessor apsosacto. Thisis
called traditio brevi manu ; bnt the sole will ola person who detains
by pennission or on behali oi another cannot, by itselt', give him
Possession: see (3) p. 326 ini.

The animus domini implies volition; hence from lack oi this power
the following classes cannot acquire Possession: (ι) Juristic persons,
Dig. 41. 2. 1. 22; (2) persons of unsound or wealr intellect, ib. t. 3 ;
(3) pupilli os tender age, unless they have their guardians’ auctoritas3
(4) persons in potestas, or manus, cannot acquire more than Detention;
lor, being incapable os holding property, they are incapable of animus
domini, except in relation to peculium castrense or quasi castrense;
‘qui in aliena potestate sunt, rem peculiarem tenere possunt, habere et
possidere non possunt, quia possessio non tantum corporis sedet
iuris est' Dig. 41. 2. 49. 1. Again, certain things are excluded from
possession ou this ground, viz. res extra commercium and the
animus domini is inconceivable in relation to an object which cannot
itscll be conceived as a single individual thing. Hence the question
arises, how iar is it possible to acquire Possession oi a single part ol
awhole? Where the single part is to be possessed alone, this is
possible (1) where the part is in point ol lact a whole itself: e. ga
plot ol land oi definite extent, which the previous possessor happens
to have treated as part ol a largcr whole: and (2) where the division
os ilie whole into parts is merely intellectual, provided the ideal part
to be possessed is precisely conceived as a definite fraction oi that
whole. But where the part is to be possessed in and through‘the
whole, the rule is, that though the whole is possessed, the parts
individually are not. For applications os this principle, which is oi
great importance in the usucapio ol buildings, see Poste, Gaius
11)·647-8·

We can also acquire Possession through other persons as well as
through ourselves. For this the following conditions must be
satisfied:

(r) The other person (whom lor convenience sake we will call the
agent) must have Detention, and also intend to acquire Possession for
the principal.

(2) The principal, or would-be possessor, must intend to acquire
