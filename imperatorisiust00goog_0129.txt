sed et maior asperitas dominorum eiusdem principis con·
stitutione coercetur. nam consultus a quibusdam praesidibus
provinciarum de his servis, qui ad aedem sacram vel ad
statuas principum coniugium, praecepit ut, si intolerabilis
videatur dominorum saevitia, cogantur servos bonis con·
dicionibus vendere, ut pretium dominis daretur, et recte:
expedit enirn rei publicae, ne quis re sua male utatur. cuius
rescripti ad Aelium Marcianum emissi verba haec sunt: ‘Do-
minorum quidem potestatem in suos servos illibatam esse
oportet nec cuiquam hominum ius suum detrahi. sed dorni-
norum interest, ne auxilium contra saevitiam vel lamem vel
intolerabilem iniuriam denegetur his qui iuste deprecantur.
ideoque cognosce de querellis eorum, qui ex familia Iulii
Sabini ad statuam confugerunt, et si vel dun'us habitos, quarn
aequum est, vel infami iniuria affectos cognoveris, veniri iube,
ita ut in potestatem domini non revertantur. qui Sabinus si
meae constitutioni fraudem lecerit, sciet me admissum severius
exsecuturum!

'Pit IX„ The children born os lawlul wedlock between an independent
citizen anda woman with whom he had connubium were born in his
potestas ; and unless he died first, or they were voluntarily released by
him, they remained under it, with trifling exceptions‚ to the day os their
death. The peculiarity oi this, as compared with other peoples, is
noticed by many writers (Gaius i. 5 5 ; cf. Sextus Empir. Pyrrhon. iii. 24
ni rr Ῥωμαίων νομοθέται τοὺς παῖδας ὑποχειρίους tol δούλους τῶν ποτέρων
relationum εἶναι ...παρ’ ἑτέροιο δὲ ὡς τυραννικὸν τοῦτο &bibini-nt, Servius
ad Verg. Aen. xi. 143 ‘filii in potestate patris. . ,servi loeo'). What is
strange about it is not so much its stringency‚ as its survival‚ through
centuries os legal history, to the time of Justinian‚ and its deliberate
perpetuation in his legislation. This is explained in some degree by the
Roman aversion to any change in old established custom which the
advance in soeial conditions did not render absolutely necessary; still
more by the lact that the patria potestas of the sixth century of our own
era was a very different institution from that of the earlier period; the
rights os the father over the person ol the child had been largelycurtailed
by both law and custom‚ and by the development os the different kinds
os peculium (Bk. ii. 9. 1, and notes, int), the position of the son in
respect ol property and contract had been largely assimilated to that ot
