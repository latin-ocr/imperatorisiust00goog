observandum est, qui litem suam lecerit. Item exercitor3
navis aut cauponae aut stabuli de dolo aut furto, quod in nave
aut in caupona aut in stabulo iactum erit, quasi ex maleficio
teneri videtur, si modo ipsius nullum est maleficium, sed ali-
cuius eorum, quorum opera navem aut cauponam aut stabulum
exerceret: cum enim neque ex contractu sit adversus eum
constituta haec actio et aliquatenus culpae reus est, quod
opera malorum hominum uteretur, ideo quasi ex maleficio
teneri videtur. in his autem casibus in lactum actio com-
petit, quae heredi quidem datur, adversus heredem autem
non competit.

duntaxat de peculio posse conveniri' Dig. 9. 4. 34 and 35. ll' the
dangerous object had been positum or suspensum by a slave, the praetor
had allowed a uoxal action, Dig. 9. 3. 1. pr. ; ib. 5. 6, and doubtless the
practice had been the same with children in power ; lor this subject see
Tit. 8 and notes iul

§a The penalty to which shipowners, inn and stable keepers were
liable lor such delicts of their employls was twice· the value ol the
property stolen or damaged, Dig. 4 9. 7. 1; 47. 5. 2. The same classes
οἰ persons were bound ex contractu to restore in safety and uninjured
the property ol travellers and others which was placed in their custody
(receptum nautarum, cauponum et stabulariorum), unless the loss was
occasioned by vis maior, unavoidable accident, or contributory negligence
of the owner: ‘ait praetor, nautae, caupones, stabularii, quod cuiusque
salvum fore receperint, uisi restituent, in eos iudicium dabo' Dig. 49
1.pr.

There is apparently no reason why the liability os masters t'or their
slaves’ delicts in geneml (Tit. sint.) and ol owncrs ol animals sor
damage done by them (Tit. 9l should not be considered quasi-delictual,
for it was enforced by special actions, which were at least as penal as
that against the judge ‘qui litem suam fecerit.² The lact seems to be that
the cases mentioned in this Title are intended only as examples os quasi-
delicts, and that the other two would naturally have found a place
among thern but lor Justiniau's inveterate habit ol following the arrange·
ment os Gaius. As the latter does not treat quasi-delict at all, he
discusses the liability os masters and fathers lor the delicts os their
slaves and children in power in close connection with a cognate question
—their liability upon their contracts 3 so that justinian, in his anxiety to

' adhere to the latter arrangement, has committed a fault os classificarion.

Before proceeding to the subject of actions in the next Title, it is
recommended that the student should read the Excursus at the end of
this Book on the earlier history ol Roman civil procedure.
