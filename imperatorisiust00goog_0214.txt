Tit. r.] DE RERUM DIVISIONE. 201

differentia est. Sed si quidem excausa donationis aut dotis 41
ant qualibet alia ex causa tradantur, sine dubio transferuntur:
venditae vero et traditae non aliter emptori adquiruntur, qnam
si is venditori pretium solverit vel alio modo ei satisfecerit,
veluti expromissore aut pignore dato. quod cavetur quidem
etiam lege duodecim tabularum: tamen recte dicitur et iure
gentium, id est iure naturali, id effici. sed si is qui vendidit
fidem emptoris secutus fuerit, dicendum est statim rem emp·
’ toris fieri. Nihil autem interest, utrum ipse dominus tradat 42
alicui rem, an voluntate eius alius. Qua ratione, si cui libera 43
negotiorum administratio a domino permissa fuerit isque ex
his negotiis rem vendiderit et tradiderit, facit cam acci-
pientis. Interdum etiam sine traditione nuda voluntas sufficit 44
domini ad rem transferendam, veluti si rem, quam tibi aliquis
commodavit aut locavit aut apud te deposuit, vendiderit tibi
aut donaverit. quamvis enim ex ea causa tibi eam non tradi·

Caesaris esse creduntur' Gaius ii. 21. Italian soil was a res mancipi,
and therefore could not be conveyed by traditio. The distinction of
tributary and stipendiary provinces was merely nominal in Gaius' time,
and ceased entirely about the end of the second century ; see lllr. Poste's
note on the passage of Gaius just cited

§ 41. The rule of the Twelve Tables here referred to, by which traditio
‘ex causa venditionis' operated a transfer of property only after the
price had been pald (cf. Varro, de re rust. 2. 2. 6, Quintil. decl. 336), or
security or credit given (cf. Dig. 18.1. 19), seems to have originally re-
lated to the mancipation form of sale only, and to have been extended
subsequently to sales generally. Some commentators account for it by
considerations of the incompleteness of the old Roman law of contract:
some suppose it to have been derived from Greece; others find in it a
rule of construction only, the intention to transfer ownership being pre-
sumed to be absent unless one of the three specified conditions is satis-
fied. The last two lines of the section must not be taken to mean that
if the vendor gives credit the property immediately passes to the vendee
without traditio: from the expression ‘venditae res et traditae’ supr.
it is clear that vendidit here means vendidit et tradidit. For the
expromissor (surety) see Bk. iii. 20 inf ; for pignus, Excursus ll, at the
end of this Book

§48. From a comparison of Dig. 3. 3. 58 with ib. 63 it would seem
that an agent entrusted with a libera administratio had wider powers
than oue whose authority was undefined.

§44 Cf. Dig, 41. r. 9. 5 ; ib. 21. 1; 41. 2. M ‘Solo animo non
posse nos adquirere possessionem, si non antecedat naturalis possessio)
