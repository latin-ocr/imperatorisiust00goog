THE CODE AND DIGEST OF JUSTINIAN. 65

commoditas exigebat '). The separate laws were to be arranged in
chronological order under generic titles, and each, so iar as was pos·
sible, identified by date and the name ol the prince to whom it owed
its introduction. The work was completed in April nn. 529, and was
published under the name codex Iustinianeus with force oi law lrom
the 16th os that month. The older codices and constitutions were at
the same time deprived oi all validity, and it was even forbidden to
appeal to any leges cited in the juristic writings, ii they¹ had been in-
corporated, even in a modified form, in the new code.

The task oi dealing in a similar manner with the writings ol the
jurists was not commenced till the end of the year An. 530, but the in·
tervening months had been employed in a preparatory labour which
could not be dispensed with, and the purpose of which was a rough
seulement oi the points in controversy between the prudentes. This
had been done by a series oi filty constitutions, known as the quin-
quaginta decisiones, which were regarded as a separate compilation:
‘Postea vero, quum vetus ius considerandum recepimus, tam quinqua·
ginta decisiones fecimus, quam alias ad commodum propositi operis
pertinentes plurimas constitutiones promulgavimus, quibus maximus
antiquarum rerum articulus emendatus et coartatus est! Subject to
these, the commission appointed to execute the work, which consisted
(besides Tribonian, who superintended it throughout) ol sixteen per·
sons, possessed the same powers of omission, alteration, and moditi-
cation as had been exercised hythe compilers os the Code. They were
instructed not to limit themselves to the five leading jurists who
occupy so prominent a position in the ‘law oi Citations,' but to select
whatever was valuable in the works of all the ‘iuris auctores' The
only exception to this was their admission oi Arcadius Charisius and
Hermogenian, both of whom lived after Modestinus, and accordingly
had not possessed the ius respondendi. The total number oi jurists
upon whom they drew ior their materials was thirty-nine. Justinian
had directed that the commission should arrange the result oi their
labeum in fisty books, which were divided into seven parts in an order
based partly on that oi the code, partly on the system of the edictal ·
commentaries The first part, called πρῶτα, comprised the first sour
books ; the second (de iudiciis) the next seven; the third (de rebus
sc. creditis) books twelve to nineteen; the fourth (umbilicus) books
twenty to twenty-seven; the fifth (de testamentis) books twenty-eight
to thirty-six ; the sixth and seventh, the contents ol which were very
miscellaneous, contained respectively books thirty-seven to sowy-four,
and iortyfive to fifty. Each book again was divided into Titles, headed
