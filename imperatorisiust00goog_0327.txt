314 EXCURSUS II.

vectigales vocantur, qui in perpetuum locantur, id est hac lege, ut
quamdiu pro his vectigal pendatur, tamdiu neque ipsis, qui conduxerint,
neque his, qui inlocum eorum successerunt, auferri eos liceat‘ Qui
in perpetuum fruendum conduxerunt a municipibus, quamvis non
efficiantur domini, tamen placuit competere eis in rem actionem
adversus ipsos municipes, ita tamen, si vectigal solvant' Dig. 6. 3.
1 and a. A new ius in re aliena had thus arisen, heritable and alien·
able both inter vivos and by will, though not yet known by a specilic
name, nor yet perhaps clothed with a very specific character. We
learn from Gaius (iii. 145) that in his day it was a question whether
the interest acquired by such lessees did not s'o closely resemble
ownership as to malie the transaction a sale rather than a contract ol
letting and hiring: but the better opinion was in the negative. Alter
the third century, and especially in the eastern portion ol the Empire,
the practice of letting agricultural land of all kinds upon these
conditions was adopted very largely by the Emperor, corporations
generally, and even by private persons: in the imperial enactments
aster Constantine we have a new terminology, lands so let being
termed praedia emphyteuticaria, and the rent called pensio or canon
more osten than vectigal. The precise nature of these perpetual
leases and ol the emphyteuta's right was determined by Zeno (iii. ²4·
ghi), who enacted that the transaction should be governed by the
rules neither ol sale nor os hire, but be a special contract by itsell:
his settlement ol the law passed with little orno alteration into the
Corpus iuris ol Justinian.

Subject to the principle that the general rules relating to emphy-
teusis might be modified by express provision or agreement (in which
case writing was necessary, Cod. 4. 66. r), those rules were as follow.
The emphyteuta (person investcd with the right) was entitled to the
complete use ol the land (Dig. 6. 3. 1. ι) and its lruits, his title to
which was separation, note on ii. 1. 35 supr, Dig. 22.1.a5. 1:
he could alter its character provided he did it no permanent injury,
Nov. 7. 3 ; 120. 6: his right was heritable and alienable inter vivos
and by will, and he could pledge it and create servitudes available
during the continuance ol his own interest. In the form of utiles
actiones he enjoyed all the remedies of a lull dominus: he had civil
(though derivative) possession, which was protected by interdicts.
But he must pay all taxes, and he was liable to eviction without any
claim to compensation lor improvements is he failed in this duty lor
three successive years, or il his rent was three years in artear, or
two it the dominus was a spiritual person; aud the latter was also
