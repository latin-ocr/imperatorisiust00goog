EARLIER HIS Τ ORY OF ROMAN CI VIL PROCEDURE. 643

The constant tendency ol the praetor to enlargc the sphere os his
extraordinaria cognitio, atter the establishment ol the empire, at the
expense os the regular procedure by formula, paved the way to the
total abolition ol the latter. An even stronger influence, which was
perpetually working against the ordo iudiciorum privatorum, was the
· new appellate jurisdiction; sor, as has been observed‚ formulae were
employed only in courts ol lowest instance ¹. Eventually the sormu-
lary procedure was abolished by Diocletian, nn. 294, magistrates
being compelled to hear and decide suits themselves through all their
stages ; and even when, from stress ol business, they were obliged to
refer an occasional action to a iudex, their relation to the latter was
no longer that os the older system ς’ the proceedings were no longer
divided between ius and iudicium, but the whole ol them were dele-
gated ; magistratus and iudex, so sar as the administration ol justice
is concerned, are interchangeable tenns. As is observed by Mr. Poste ²,
the libellary procedure in use in the time os Jrrstinian was essentially
the same as cognitio extraordinaria ⁸.

Ἀ sure index oi the increasing activity ol the extraordinaria cognitio is the
frequent use oi the expression ‘iudex pedaneus' (χαμωδααστής, Theophilus) by the
classical jurists. This originated in the practice ol calling the magistrate himsell'
‘iuden‘ which was only natural when he took to personally hearing and deciding
many actions3 ‘iudex pedaneus' is the iudex insoucted by formula.

⁸ Cl. Bk. iv. 15. Ssupr. Several topics which are oi importauce in the lormulary
procedure have been omitted in this excursus because they demand discussion
under the later system as well, and consequently are touched upon in the notes to
the textos Bk. iv: e. g. Processuul Agency, Title ¹03 Sutisdatio. Title 11 ς Prescrip·
tion and Pendeucy, Title ¹²3 Interdicts, 'litle 153 Restraints upon reckless Litiga-
