Non tamen, ut omnimodo valeat testamentum, sufficit haec
observatio, quam supra exposuimus. sed qui filium in po-
testate habet, curare debet, ut eum heredem instituat vel
exheredem nominatim faciat: alioquin si eum silentio prae·
terierit, inutiliter testabitur, adeo quidem ut, etsi vivo patre
filius mortuus sit, nemo ex eo testamento heres existere pos·
sit, quia scilicet ab initio non constiterit testamentum. sed
non ita de filiabus vel aliis per virilem sexum descendentibus
liberis utriusque sexus suerat antiquitati observatum: sed si
non fuerant heredes scripti scriptaeve vel exheredati exhere-
dataeve, testamentum quidem non infirmabatur, ius autem
adcrescendi eis ad certam portionem praestabatur. sed nec

mr. xm Having ascertained who can make wills (Tit. 12) and in
what necessary form, ir any, they must be expressed (Tits. ro and 11),
Justinian proceeds to their necessary or most usual contents, viz. exhere-
dations (Tit. 13), the institution of the heir or heirs (Tit. 14), and substi-
tutions (Tits ις and 16).

The practice oi exheredation, based on the patria potestas, ξ 7, is
peculiarly Roman, and a clear survival os the old joint ownership oi pro·
perty by family groups, Gaius ii. 157, Dig. 28. 2. rr, Tit. 19. 2 int‘. The
Roman law regarded certain ol a man’s relations as having so strong a
claim to succeed to his property, that it required him, if he wished effec-
tually to exclude them, to disinherit them in his will ; not, as we should,
by simply not mentioning them at all, but by explicitly stating his desire
that they should not be his heirs Merely to pass thern over, without
either instituting thern heirs or expressly disinheriting them, did not ex-
clude them at all; it simply avoided the will, either in whole, or in part.
What classes oi relations the civil and the praetorian law respectively
required should be thus disinherited, the forms by which exheredation
was effected, and the final changes made in this department by Justinian‚
appear in this Title. *

Whethera will was void, in which a filiusfamilias of the first degree,
who died after its execution in the testators lifetime, was praeteritus or
not disinherited in proper form, bad been a question between the two
schools oi jurists. The Sabinians, whose opinion Justinian here con-
firms, pronounced it void ab initio ; the Proculians held that it was void
only if the son in question outlived the testator, Gaius ii. ¹²3·

Sui in the first degree, i. e. the testator’s own sons, natural or adoptive,
it in his power at the time os the execution oi the will (see Tit. 19.
'2 ini), were required by the civil law to be disinherited nominatim, in the
