rape oi the Sabine women, and is expressly stated by Festus, who
ascribes the custom to Romulus' success in thus providing himself
with a wife. Even the gods were supposed to get their earthly minis·
ters in much the same unceremonious manner ; the vestal virgin, says
Gellius (i. τις 13) ‘pontificis maximi manu prehensa ab eo parente
in cuius potestate est veluti bello capta abducitur! The spear was the
oldest symbol oi right; hence there was no stronger title than pur-
chase ‘sub basta,’ at a sale held by state authority ; it was planted in
the ground in the centumviral court, which bad a special jurisdiction

and its use in manumission per vindictam will occur to every reader.
Property in land was never called anything by the Romans but prae·
dium; the analogy with praeda, ‘booty‚’ suggests itself at once, and
has been noticed by early writers, one of whom remarks ‘antiqui
agros quos bello ceperant ut praedae nomine habebant„¹ Again, the
term manus, meaning primarily ‘hand‚' and derivatively ‘power,' ‘lorce,'
‘control’ plays an extremely prominent part in early legal phraseology.
Perhaps its frequency in procedure (eg. manum conserere, manus
iniectio) is due to the survival in judicial institutions oi traces ol an
older system, namely‚ violent seli-tedress os wrong; but Sir H. Maiae
bas observed (Ancient Law p. 317) that there is very strong reason
lor believing that manus was the ancient general term expressing

and there is an affinity between herus, ‘owner,' and the Greek χείρ,
through the Sanskrit hr, which has the same meaning as tbe Latin
root cap. On the other hand, while to denote man the Sanskrit and
Greek agree (nri, nara, ἀνήρ), the Romans have discarded the corre·
sponding word, and use ‘vir,' which in Sanskrit means ‘warriora’ they
name him not [τοττι his sex, but {rom his, calling and occupation:
‘virtue' is conceived first and ioremost as valour in war, only later as
purity and honesty. The very name in which the Romans delighted,
and which their satirists cast in their teeth-Quirites—may be taken
as afinal illustration: Quiris or Curis in old Sabine is equivalent to
hasta ; Quirites are ‘spearmen τ’ and thus we see how dominium ex
iure Quiritiumhas a deeper meaning, as carrying us back to the
prehistoric time when the strong man armed could alone possess his
goods in peace.

In such a social condition the only mode in which a man who
conceived himself wronged by another could obtain satisfaction was
by taking the law, as it is said, into his own hands. Α system oi
