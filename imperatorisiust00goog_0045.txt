32 INTRODUCTION.

tury ol the Republic it became very usual lor the praetorto vary the
mles stated in his edictum perpetuum by subsidiary edicts issued
during his year oi office. This violation oi constitutional usage
menaced the stability ol the law, and accordingly was made illegal
by a lex Cornelia (nc. 67), ‘aliam deinde legem Cornelius, etsi nemo
repugnare ausus est, multis tamen invitis, tulit, ut praetores ex edictis
suis perpetuis ius dicerent. Quae res cunctam gratiam ambitiosis prae-
toribus, qui varie ius dicere solebant, sustulit' (Asconius ad Cic. orat.
pro Cornelio, cf. Dion Cassius xxxvi. 23).

The reference to Verres seems to make this a convenient place to
describe how the number oi praetors was increased, and to point out
the bearing ol this on the development of Roman law. As will be
shortly seen, the large number of foreigners who established them-
’ selves at Rome lor commercial purposes led (ac. 247) to the ap·
pointment oi a second praetor, called the praetor peregrinus, who
administered justice at Rome as between loreigners or foreigners and
citizens. This praetor also issued an edictum perpetuum consisting,
as will be seen, ol rules drawn from what was known as the ius gen·
tium, a general law applicable to the Romans aud to all people,
which became binding lor Romans ahter se by being imported steadily,
though gradually, from the edict oi the praetor peregrinus into that ol
the praetor urbanus. The former edict may thus be regarded asan
almost inexhaustible reservoir whence the praetor urbanus drew those
streams of ius naturale by which the civil law oi Rome was expanded
and liberalised. When the territories oi the state were extended
beyond the limits of Italy new praetors were made. Thus, two were
created, nc. 227, lor the administration ol Sicily and Sardinia, and two
more were added when the Spanish provinces were formed, s.c. 197.
Sulla increased the number from six to eight, which Julius Caesar raised
successively to ten, twelve, sourteen, and sixteen. Many ol these,
and also the consuls alter their year oi office, were entrusted with the
govemment ol a province; usually lora year, though the time was
osten prolonged. Such governors, whether proconsuls or propraetors‚
were invested with imperium and jurisdiction within the limits oi
their respective provinces, and presided there as completely over the

’ administration of civil justice as did the praetor urbanus at Rome.

Accordingly, provincial govemors naturally adopted the practice ol
issuing, at the commencement ol their term of office, an edictum
stating the rules and principles which they should observe in the
exercise oi their jurisdiction. Hence arose a number of edicta pro·
vincialia, which we should have supposed consisted partly oi rules
