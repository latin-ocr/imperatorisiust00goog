’ casuri sunt. Cum autem in compluribus aliis causis postumia
pro iam natis habentur, et in hac eausa placuit non minus
postumis quam iam natis testamento tutores dari posse, si
modo in ea causa sint, ut, si vivis parentibus nascerentur, sui
et in potestate eorum fierent. Sed si emancipato filio tutore
a patre testamento datus fuerit, confirmandus est ex sententia
praesidis omnimodo, id est sine inquisitione.

§4 Postumi liberi are children born alter the execution of the will:
whether after the death oi the testator or in his lile-time is immaterial.
A paterfamilias could not give a testamentary guardian to a posthumous
grandson, il, supposing he had died immediately after the execution of
tbe will, the grandson would have been born in the 'potestas os his own
rather, the testators son: ior in that case, the father being in the same
potestas, the child would not have been a suus heres to the testator.
Guardianship was only intended as a substitute sor patria potestas, and
the existence oi the latter barred the possibility ol the sonner.

§ ⁶. There were live other cases in which magisterial confinnation ol
a testamentary appointment was required, viz. (1) where a father gave
by will a guardian to his natural child, Dig. 26. 3. 73 (2) where the ap·
pointment was made in unconfirmed codicils or in an invalid will, Dig. ib.
1.1 ; (3) where the appointment violated the SC. Libonianum by being
written by the guardian himsels; here a ‘praevia inquisitio' was neees-
sary, Dig. ib. 2. 29: 48. 10.18. 13 (4) where a mother attempted to
give a testamentary guardian to her child, the appointment would be
confirmed only ‘ex inquisitione‚' and only 11 the child were instituted
heir in the will, Dig. ib. 2. 4; ( 5) il a man appointed a testamentary
guardian to the child ol some other person, the appointment would be
confirmed ex inquisitione if the child were instituted heir in the will, and
had no other property, Dig. ib. 3. 4. 5. ln all these cases, or at any rate
where an inquisitio was held, the appointment was deemed magisterial
rather than testamentary, Dig. ib. 2. 26. 2; 48. 10.18. 1.

ult. XIV. The two main rules oi testamentary appointments are,
(1) there must be testamentilactio (Bia ii. 19. ⁴sini.) between testator
and the intended guardian, Dig. 26. 2. 21, and (2) the person must be
clearly specihed, Bk. ii. 20. 27 ini.
