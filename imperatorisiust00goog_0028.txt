RELATION OF PUBLIC AND PRIVATE LA W. 15

years they remained the only complete legislation which professed to
embrace the whole positive law oi Rome, and though in point of
lact the greater part of their original substance was repealed or
modified by subsequent enactments, the Roman citizen, even under
the Empire‚ always continued to revere them as the solid basis ol the ,
noble system oi jurispmdence by which all his rights and duties were ·
determined ; and it was only by the great work oi Justinian that,
nine hundred and eighty-four years after their enactment‚ they were
sormally deprived ol their authority.

At this point it will be well to pause in order to look back over the
centuries behind us and try to ascertain what was the material con-
tent and what the scope ol the customary law which, as we have
seen, was to the early Romans the only rule ol life, and which was

summed up and (ii we may use the expression) codified in the ,

Twelve T ables. Ausonius (idyll xi. 61) describes the contents oi
the latter as ‘ius triplexz'

‘Sacrum privatum, populi commune quod usquam est.'

But there is little to be said on this particular point except what can
be inferred from the fragments which have been preserved to us.
These relate to the procedure in an action, especially summons
(Table i), execution (iii), mancipation (vi) and emancipation (iv),
succession (v), curatela of furiosi (vi), lurtum, iniuria, and other
forms ol delict (viii), and finally burial oi the dead (x). As might
perhaps have been expected, the only really important department ol
the private code upon which, so iar as we know, the Twelve Tables
contained no provisions, is contract.

Legal antiquaries on the continent who have accepted as sub· '
stantially true the myth which ascribes the origin os Rome to the
union oi three tribes belonging to different ethnic stocks, two of
which are by them identified as Pelasgic and Sabine ¹, have spent
much ingenuity in attempting to detect the original diversity os the
elements contributed to the common stoclt ol jurispmdence by the
two dominant tribes, and to trace 'the gradual process by which these
were blended into a homogeneous system oi law. They speak os
the clement peculiar to the Ramnes, as opposed to that peculiar to
the Quirites; the genius oi the former people lay in the direction os
conquest and activity in external relations, that ol the latter in the
promotion ol domestic order and peaceiul internal development ; and
