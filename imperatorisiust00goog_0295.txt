mationem, agere potest. Ea quoque res, quae in rerum
natura non est, si modo sutura est, recte legatur, veluti fructus
qui in illo fundo nati erunt, aut quod ex illa ancilla natum
serit. Si eadem res duobus legata sit sive coniunctim sive
disiunctim‚ si ambo perveniant ad legatum, scinditur inter eos
legatum: si alter deficiat, quia aut spreverit legatum aut vivo
testatore decesserit aut alio quolibet modo defecerit, totum ad
collegatarium pertinet. coniunctim autem legatur, veluti si
quis dicat ‘Titio et Seio hominem Stichum do lego τ’ dis·
iunctim ita ‘Titio hominem Stichum do leg0, Seio Stichum
do lego.’ sed et si expresserit ‘eundem hominem Stichum,’

solatas he obtained it aiter the execution ol tbe will for valuable con·
sideration. lt at that time it belonged to him, the disposition is void,
even though he subsequently ceased to be its owner, unless the legaey
was made conditional on his alienating it before the testators death
(Dig.34.7. 1. a), or unless his own ownership was revocable (Dig. 1.
82. 1), or, thirdly‚ unless the testator or the heir had some real right over
the object by which the legatee could practically be deprived of its
enjoyment (eg. pignus, usufruct, or emphyteusis), or a personal right
by which he could be forced to deliver it up, Dig. 1. 71. 5, ib. 39. 2.

§ 8. So far as the form per vindicationem is concemed, the rule as to
legacy oi the same thing disiunctim to two or more persons is similarly
stated by Gaius ii. 199, but in ξ 205 he adds ‘si eadem res duobus pluri·
busve per damnationem legata sit. . . disiunctim, singulis solida res
debetur, ut scilicet heres alteri rem, alteri aestimationem eius praestare
debeat! ln this point the SC. Neronianum appears not to have operated
at all: otherwise it is difficult to see how the rule did not become
exaetly the contrary os that which is here stated in the text. Justinian
enacted that in no case should co-legatees oi the same thing be entitled,
the one to it, the other or rest to its value, ‘nisi testator apertissime et
expressim disposuerit, ut uni quidem res solida, aliis autem aestimatio
rei singulis in solidum praestetur’ Cod. 6. 51. 11. As Gaius remarks
(ii. 206), an important modification was made in the law os accrual
between coheirs and co-legatees by the leges lulia and Papia Poppaea,
sor which see on Tit. 14 pt. supr.; these statutes‚ however, were no
longer in force under Justinian, who speaks of the caducitas which they
introduced as altogether abolished from his system, Cod 1. 17. 7, Const.
Tanta a. 6.

Two or more persons are said to be co-heirs or co-legatees when
the same thing is given to both or all of them. As to the technical ex-
pressions or modes by which testators could effect such conjunctim, we
must at the outset exclude what is called conjunction ‘verbis,’ in which
each ol the apparently conjoined heirs or legatees is in lact given some·
thing different from the other or rest, ‘item verbis, non etiam re [con-
