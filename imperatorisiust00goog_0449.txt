t ex co obligatio nec mandati inter vos actio nascitur. Man-
dantis tantum gratia intervenit mandatum, veluti si quis tibi
mandet, ut negotia eius gerereS, vel ut fundum ei emeres, vel

2ut pro eo sponderes. Tua et mandantis, veluti si mandet
tibi, ut pecuniam sub usuris crederes ei,'qui in rem ipsius
mutuaretur,' aut si volente te agere cum eo ex fideiussoria
causa mandet tibi, ut cum reo agas periculo mandantis, vel ut
ipsius periculo stipuleris ab eo, quem tibi deleget in id quod

stibi debuerat. Aliena autem causa intervenit mandatum,

§t The use ol ‘sponderes’ is mere pedantry; in Dig.17.1.2.1;
ib. 6. 2 ; ib. 8. 8, and other passages relating to this subject, we read only
ol fideiussio. The second ol the three instances given here may be
illustrated thus. A becomes surety (fideiussor) to you lor B, who owes
you 5ol.: on your proposing to sue him on this contract ol suretyship‚
he commissions you (mandat) to sue B, the principal debtor‚ in lieu ot'
him at his (Αέ) risle This is to A's interest, because he is protected
from your action at any rate lor a time, an advantage which he could not
have otherwise secured, as N ov. 4 had not yet introduced the beneficium
ordinis (p. 413 supr.) ; and he is altogether so protected if B proves solvent.
It is to your interest, because the mandate may 3ηά probably will contain
more savourable conditions than the fideiussio‚ e. g. the security os a hy·
potheca (ὑπόθου γὰρ ὅτι ἡ r’yyriry γέγονε δίχα ὑποθήκης, τὸ δι’ μάνδιπον μετὰ
ὑποθήκης Theoph.)‚ and belore Justinian's legislation it would have been
most advantageous to you il you had been in doubt which was solvent,
A or B, lor in virtue ol it you could first sue B without risk, 3ηά then, is
he proved to have insufficient assets‚ you could sue A by actio mandati,
which you could not have done by action on the guaranty‚ because he
was released as fideiussor by litis contestatio with B. This was remedied
by Justinian in Cod. 8. 42. 28 ‘generaliter sancimus, quemadmodum in
mandatoribus statutum est, ut, contestatione contra unum ex his sacta,
alter non liberetur, itaet in fideiussoribus observari!

To explain the third instance we will suppose that A owes 5ol. to B,
who owes the same sumto C. B gives a commission to C to stipulate
from A at his (Βέ) rislr that he (A) will pay him (C) the sol. which he
owes B ; ‘delegare est vice sua alium reum dare creditori vel cui iusserit'
Dig. 46. 2. ιι. As Mr. Poste points out, the result of this transaction,
compounded of mandate and stipulation, is two novatione, extinguishing
the original debts of A to B, 3ηά Β to C, and creating two new liabilities,
a debt ol sol. owed by A to C, 3ηά 3 mandate between B 3ηά C under
which B is guarantor of A; it is to B’s interest, because he is released
stom the action on the debt to C, which might have been stricti iuris,
and to which he was immediately liable, 3ηά can only be sued, it' at all,
by actio mandati, which is bonae fidei ; it is t'avourable to C, because he
thereby gets two debtors (a principal and a surety) instead osone.

§8. ll A commissioned B to do something sor C, he had no rights
