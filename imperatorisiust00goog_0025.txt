12 INTRODUCTION.

this anomaly had originally been grounded on political consideratione,
it was now retained 101 purposes 01 mere annoyance only ; but the
deliverance 01 the plebeians was not yet. Even now too they were
still legally incapable 01 possessing the ager publicus ; and this ap-
peared the more hard, because, on the one hand, their taxation was
out 01 all proportion to that 01 the patricians, while the possession
01 the ager publicus was untaxed, and yet, 00 the other, it was
mainly through their own valour that it had become ager publicus
at all. Some slight compensation was made 101 this by a lex Cassia
(uc. 486) which ellected a distribution 01 newly-conquered territory,
and placed some restrictions on the patrician enjoyment 01 the public
land. A third grievance was the unlimited power 01 the magistrates
10 inflict pecuniary fines; this was curtailed by the leges Menenia,

Tarpeia, and Papiria, passed between 460 and 430 nc. Lastly, the
patriciana controlled the entire administration 01 justice; it was the
consul who presided over the preliminary stage 01 every action, and
il he did 001 decide it out 01 hand, the judges were most usually
the patrician decemviri, upon whom this sunction had been cast by
Servius Tullius, it was the pontifices themselves, members 01 the
’ patrician caste, who interpreted the law, and solved its knotty prob-

lems. Moreover, the very enforcement ol the law depended on the
observance 01 minute lorms and technicalities 01 which, by reason
01 their implication with the ius sacrum, the plebeian could know
little or nothing. Some slight amelioration ol these hard conditions
must have been allorded by the lex Pinaria ¹, which belongs to this
period, and which, in certain classes 01 actions (we may suppose, in
particular, actions 01 debt), allowed the parties to choose a single
judge, to the exclusion 01 the magistrates’ own jurisdiction and 01 the
decemviral court (Gaius iv. 15). But the class from which the judge
was to be chosen seems to have been limited in some way 01 which
we have no certain knowledge; and the chiel interest 01 the lex
Pinaria is that it served as a precedent for the principle enunciated
by Cicero (pro Cluentio 43) in the words ‘nerninem voluerunt
maiores nostri esse iudicem nisi qui inter adversarios convenisset)

In the year 11. 0. 462 the tribune Terentilius had procured a reso-
lution 01 the plebs, ‘ ut quinque viri creentur legibus de imperio con·
sulari scribendis,¹ which the senate refused to send 00 10 the comitia
centuriata. Nothing daunted, he proposed, in the next year and in
the same way,a codification 01 the whole law by decemviri. This

,¹ Its date was, according to Huschke, 11. c. 47² (Versassung des Servius p. 595).
