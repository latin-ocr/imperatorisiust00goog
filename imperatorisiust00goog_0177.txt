DE EXCUSATIONIBUS.

Excusantur autem tutores vel curatores variis ex causis:
plerumque autem propter liberos sive in potestate sint sive
emancipati. si enim tres liberos quis superstites Romae
habeat vel in Italia quattuor vel in provinciis quinque, a tutela
vel cura possunt excusari exemplo ceterorum munerum: nam
et tutelam et curam placuit publicum munus esse. sed
adoptivi liberi non prosunt, in adoptionem autem dati naturali
patri prosunt. item nepotes ex filio prosunt, utin locum
patris succedant, ex filia non prosunt. frlii autem superstites
tantum ad tutelae vel curae muneris excusationem prosunt,
defuncti non prosunt. sed si in bello amissi sunt, quaesitum
est, an prosint. et constat eos solos prodesse qui in acie
amittuntur: hi enim, quia pro re publica ceciderunt, in

or cura were secured against loss from the dishonesty or negligence of
their tutors or curators. They were also protected (1) by the possibility
of remotio, Tit. 26 inf. (2) By statutory restrictions on the tutor's or
curator’s powers, especiallyin respect of alienation: see on Tit. 13. 1
supr. (3) By a statutory hypothec over the tutor’s or curators whole
property, which had certainly been established as early as the time of
Constantine, Cod. 5. 37. 20. (4) By responsibility of other persons for
the tutor or curator (in addition to his sureties and the appointing magis-
trate). These were the affirmatores, who had at the inquisitio borne
witness to the character of the person appointed, and the nominatores,
persons who proposed or suggested a tutor or curator in any particular
case; this might happen (a) at the petitio tutoris. lfa pupil had no
tutor, anyone could apply for or suggest one, and some persons were
bound to do this: e. g. the mother (Bk iii. 3.6 inf), and other heirs
presumptive ab intestato, under penalty, in default, of forfeiting their
rights of succession if the pupil died impubes, Dig. 26. 6. 2. 2: also the
libertus, under a pecuniary penalty, Dig. 16. 2. r. (b) In cases where a
man was appointed tutor or curator by a magistrate, he could usually
procure exemption by suggesting some one better qualiiied (potioris
nominatio) by reason of relationship. This right of nominatio was in
many cases restricted (fragm. Vat. 158, Paul. rec. sent. a. 29 ‘qui
potiores nominare non possunt ’>, and was altogether abolished by Jus-
tinian.

nte. XXV. For the Eastern Empire Romae means Constantinople,
and ltalia Thrace, schol. Theoph. By ‘ut in patris locum succedant'
is meant that any number of grandchildren by one dead son count only
as one: ὅσοι δ’ ἂν ὦσιν ἔγγονοι ἐξ ἑνὸς vluit, ἀντὶ ἑνὸς τὶκνου ἀριθμοῦνται, Dig.
