opportunity displayed itseli. Among the leading Sabinians may be
mentioned C. Cassius Longinus, who died under Vespasian, Caelius
Sabinus, Javolenus Priscus¹ (206), Salvius Julianus (457), who has been
already mentioned as the compilet oi the Edictum perpetuum under
Hadrian, Sextus Pomponius (585), Sextus Caecilius Africanus(131),and
finally Gaius (535), author oi thelastitutionum Commentarii quatuor,
the tirst book, so far as we know, bearing this title 3ηά intended ior
elementary instruction, and also oi Libri septem rerum quotidianarum
sive aureorum, and Commentaries on the Twelve Tables, the lex
Iulia 3ηά Papia, 3ηά the urban, provincial, and aedilician Edicts.
Labeo’s first two successore were M. Cocceius Nerva, mentioned iu

Tacitus, Ann. vi. 36, and Sempronius Proculus (37), after whom this
school was called Proculian; his principal followers were Pegasus,
praelectus urbi under Vespasium the younger Juventius Celsus ((43),
3ηά Neratius Priscus (64), whom Trajan is said to have preferred to

Hadrian as his successor in the empire. Alter him on the one hand,
and Gaius on the other, we have no further traces ot the controversy
between the schools. It would seem that a reaction (ηά set· in,
probably because differences oi opinion which had once been genuine
had now been degraded to mere hair splittlng, or because the jurists
on both sides had become possessed with the spirit ο( Labeo, 3ηά
were beginning to revolt against the abuse of authority; at least we
may inser from Gaius (((ἱ. 98) that the pupils bad talento criticising
their masters. Bdcking (Institutionen ξ (7) is of opinion that the
disappearance ol the schools is sufficiently accounted lor by the con·
dition of law and legislation in the ageni the Antonines, and by the
establishment of public instruction in legal subjecte, upon which more
will be said herealter. However this may be, the subsequent jurists
toolr each his own line, though only the most famous oi thern need
be mentioned here. From Ulpius Marcellus, commander·in·chiei iu
Britain underCommodus, there are 3 hundred 3ηά fifty-nine excerpts
in the Digest 3 Q. Cervidius Scaevola (307) was teacher oi Papinian and
oi the emperor Septimius Severus; besides these, Claudius Trypho·
ninus (79), Venuleius Saturninus (71), Callistratus (39), Aelius Marci-
anus (375), 3ηά Florentinus (42), deserve notice. But the greatest
names are yet to come. Aemilius Papinianus was esteemed by all
his successors the greatest os Roman jurists. He commenced under
Marcus Aurelius (a, n. 161-180) a political career which ended in his
