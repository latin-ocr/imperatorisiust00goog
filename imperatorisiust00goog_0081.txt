68 INTRODUCTION.

which the'human will can operate. These are, in briei, one's own
person, and the extemal world ; the latter again being divided into
reasonable and unreasonable, or persons and things

As regards one’s own person, our attention is at once directed to
the so-called primordial rights, or rights of personal inviolability in
respect ol lreedom, reputation, and so lorth. These, however, apert
and by themselves, Savigny does not consider a proper subject ol law.
He admits that a man ought to have the sole control os his own
person and powers, but the right to such control does not sall within
the ken ol the law except as the basis ol rights and relations which
belong to other parts ol the code-which, that is to say, ought not to
be regarded simply as developments ol this personal inviolability, from
which their context is clearly distinguishable (System i. p. 336-7)
‘Aequired rights’ are thus the only proper subject ol private law, and
these, as hasbeen pointed out, can relate to either persons or things.

i. Over unreasonable portions ol the external world, or things, a
person may exercise absolute control. Such absolute control is called
dominion or ownership‚ and the law relating to it is lrnown as the law
ol things (Sachenrecht). Ownership, however, is capable of many
forms and modificatious3 the separation ol its elements leads to the
conceptiones servitudes and other rights in re aliena3 and again, its
actual exercise is distinguishable lrom the right, whence anses tbe law
relating to Possession. The main elements ol the law os things will
thus be Ownership, iura in re aliena, and Possession.

ii. To the reasonable ponion ol the external world, or to other per·
sons, one may stand in either os two quite different relations Firstly,
one man may be related to another somewhat in the way in which,
as we have seen, he may be related to things. Over a thing he may
exercise complete dominion, in which case it is absolutely subjected
to his will; overa person he cannot exercise this power, which im·
plies an entire negation os lreedom and personality. But he may ex·
ercise a partial dominion, a dominion which consists with that other
person¹s freedom, inasmuch as it does not extend to all his actions,
but only to one or some ol them. Il one man is absolutely subjected
to the will of another, he is, jurally, not a person, but a thing3 but il
that etheris, jurally, master ol only certain ol his actions, and jurally
entitled to compel him to this or that act or forbearance only, he is,
except in respect ol this portion ol his activity, still lree and a person.

We thus get the idea of obligation as distinct from dominion, and
these together form the two parts of what is called the law ol property,
the relation between them being twolold: (a) il one person refuses to
