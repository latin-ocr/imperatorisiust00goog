r. 17. a. 17). lt had thus become extremely necessary that these
should be multiplied, and also, il possible, recast in a more convenient
lonn, which should enable such alterations to be made in the substan-
tive law as circumstances demanded, and also secure the incorporation
in the main work os the detached constitutions which had been pub·
lished since the code ol Theodosius. Theodosius had himself con·
ceived the design ol combining the writings ol the authorized jurists
and the imperial legislation (which had now been long contrasted
under the terms ius and leges) in one comprehensive statute book ;
but the idea ol combination had produced no results, and ol that
emperor's two great relorms the one related to ius, the other to leges
only. When Justinian had resolved on his great scheme ol givinga
new lorm to the Roman law, the enormous mass ol the material and
the convenience ol dividing the labour ol codilication caused him to
preler the retention ol the two elements ol the ius scriptum in separa·
tion. He also hesitated whether to retain them in their existing shape,
subject ol course to such alterations as were called sor by the neces·
sity ol harmonising them e'nler se, and with the law as at present
administered, or, while preserving their tenor aud substance, to com·
pletely alter their literary lorm; he tells us that a regard lor the past,
and admiration lor the services which the jurists and his imperial pre·

decessors had rendered to jurisprudence, had decided him in favour
ol the lormer altemative.

The codification ol the imperial legislation, as having been in part
already executed, presented the least difficulty ; its claim was also the
more pressing, because 311 imperial officers were required by law to
possess copies ol the existing codices. This task was accordingly
iirst taken in hand. ln 3. 3. 528 Justinian appointed a commission
sor the purpose ol ten persons, among them being Tribonian, who
played so important a part in the legislative work ol the next few

years, and who not improbably suggested to his master his whole
scheme ol legal reform. The work with which they were entrusted

was to form a single code out ol the codices Gregorianus, Hermoge-
nianus, and Theodosianus, arrd the constitutions issued since un. 439 ;
omitting 311 that was superfluous, reconciling such euactments as were
inconsistent with one another, and, where convenience required, com·
bining several into one (‘ colligentes vero in unam sanctionem, quae
in variis constitutionibus dispersa sunt, et sensum earum clariorem
efficientes '); finally, they were authorized to make any alterations in
individual constitutions which they should deem necessary (⁴ adiicientes
