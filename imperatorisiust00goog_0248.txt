Testamentum ex eo appellatur, quod testatio mentis est.

Sed ut nihil antiquitatis penitus ignoretur, sciendum estl
olim quidem duo genera testamentorum in usu fuisse, quorum
altero in pace et in otio utebantur, quod calatis comitiis
appellabatur, altero, curn in proelium exituri essent, quod
procinctum dicebatur. accessit deinde tertium genus testa·
mentorum, quod dicebatur per aes et libram, scilicet quia per
emancipationem, id est imaginariam quandam venditionem,
agebatur quinque testibus et libripende civibus Romanis
puberibus praesentibus et eo qui familiae emptor dicebatur.

by both Gaius and Justinian. The two modes ol succession are mutually
egr-clusit& 11 a man made a viillfallhis‘pro‘perty (uriiess’he'wer‘e a
soldier) must perlorce go to the heir or heirs therein instituted, even
though expressly instituted to certain portions ο1 11 only: there was
nothing left 101 the rules ο1 intestate succession to operate on, or to go to
the person or persom who would have succeeded him had he died in·
testate: ‘neque enim idem ex parte testatus et ex parte intestatus de·
cedere potest, nisi sit miles' Tit 14. 5 inf. : cs. Cicero, de invent. 2. 21.

Two other technical terms require a brief explanation. ln some cases
the law cast the inheritance· upon a person or persons whether they
wished it or not, Tit. 19· 1 and 2 inl: immediately upon a man's decease
they became heirs ipso sacto, and could in no way at law disencumber
themselves ο1 the legal rights and duties, taken in the aggregate, which
that character imposed upon them But in other cases (Tit. ro 5 inf.) no
one became heres immediately, though some one (or more) was entitled
to become so 11 he pleased: here, as soon as it was known who was the
person so entitled, the hereditas was said to be ‘delata' to him : delatio
is the right actually to become heir : ‘delata hereditas intellegitur, quam
quis possit adeundo consequi’ Dig.5o.16.151. ll, after consideration,
he decides that the inheritance is worth taking, delatio is followedby
aditio (Tit 19 5 and 7 int), actual acceptance of the succession. First
comes the death ; then delatio 3 and finally, aster a greater or less interval,
aditio. But, whether the law makes one heir nolens volens, or whether
one deliberately accepts the inheritance alter sully weighing its advan-
tages and disadvantages one cannot get rid ο1 the character ο1 heres,
with all its liabilities, when one has once been invested with it: ‘semel
heres, semper heres! How lar this principle, as well as the other already
cited supr. from Tit. ¹4· 5, had been modified at the end ο1 Justinian's
legislative work will appear from the following Titles.
