rights ¹. In other words, persona is aman regarded as invested with
legal rights, or as capable oi acquiring them, so that our attention is
drawn away irom the man to the rights, orto the capacity os having
them in virtue oi which he is a persona. The aggregate ol a man’s
rights was called his status 3 and accordingly the old civilians defined
a persona as ‘homo cum statu suo consideratus! But what is it in
virtue os which a man has legal rights? In modern times it is usually
in virtue oi his submissim, absolute or partial, to the sovereign ol
the country in which be happens to reside; aman is usually capable
os acquiring all the rights which are comprised under the private law

oi a state within whose limits be is domiciled. This view is essen·
tially modern, and by realiaing its strangeness to the Roman mind we

shall have advanced some way towards understanding the ius per·
sonarum. To a man, as lree, the Roman state conceded such rights
onlyas were based on the ius gentium ; but the civis possessed lar
more rights, even in the field oi private law, than the free peregrinus;
and many os these he enjoyed not through being a civis but because
he was a member oi a definite Roman lamily. The rights or status

with which aman could be invested within the Roman state were ’

thus always referable to either freedom, citizenship, or family connec-
tion; 3ηά this way oi looking at the matter became so habitual to the
Roman, that of status in general he has little to say3 be always con·
nects it with one oi these three ‘momenta' and classifies a man's
capacity of acquiring rights (or ‘ status ¹) according as he is merely free,
is a citizen, or belongs to the agnatic circle oi this or that Roman
familia

1t then the ‘law oi persons' is the law relating to human beings
considered as invested with or as capable osacquiring rights, it is clearly
much the same thing as the law relating to these three ‘status' oi
libertas, civitas, 3ηά familia: it is ‘the treatment ol men in respect ol
their position in and in relation to the Roman state, because, accord-
ing to that position, their capacity ol right, and their capacity of per-
forming legal acts, will differ².' But it is obvious that much that can
be said, in respect at any rate oi one oi these three topics, has no
relation to private law; the latter has to point out distinctions between
persons only so far as they are ol importance to itsell, and the distinc-

tion between civis and peregrinus is mainly publici iuris. Nor again
