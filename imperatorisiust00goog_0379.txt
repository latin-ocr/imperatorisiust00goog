366 INSY IT UT IONUM LIBRI QUATTUOR. [lmlll.

paterni quam materni, item filius filia, nepos neptis tam ex
filio quam ex filia, irater soror sive consanguinei sive uteriui):

( 5) T um quam ex familia : the patron or patroness’s nearest collateral
agnates.

(6) Patronus, patrona, liberi et parentes eorum: i. e. the patrou’s or
patroness’s own patron orpatroness, and his or her cognates in the direct
line.

(7) ·Vir et uxor : the surviving consort of the deceased, who by dre civil
law had no right oi succession whatever. '

(8) The collateral cognates oi the patron within the sirth degree, Tit
5. 5 supr. ln the extremely improbable event oi there being no one
belonging to even the lowest of these classes to take bonorum pouessio,
the estate escheated to the aerarium (later to the fiscuslz ‘si nemo sit,
ad quem bonorum possessio pertinere possit, aut sit quidem, sed ius
suum omiserit, populo bona deferuntur ex lege Iulia caducariaf Ulpiau,
reg. 28. 7.

lt will be observed that, besides class 3, which related to what cannot
ever have been a very common case, classes 5, 6, and 8 did not come
into consideration unless the intestate were a freedman or a freedwoman.
Class 3 became meaningless under Justinian’s new system of emancipa-
tion‚ and the other three he altogether abolished. Thus in his legislation
intestate bonorum possessores were arranged in four classes only, their
order being—liberi, legitimi, cognati, vir et uxor ; but he also retained au
anomalous group (58 ini), called sometimes for the sake oi brevity ‘tum
quibus ex legibus,’ comprising those persons to whom the statute law
had enacted that bonorum possessio (as distinct from the hereditas)
should be given : e. g. the patron in concurrente with the children oi a
libertus under the lex Papia Poppaea, Tit. 7. 1 and 2 supr: ‘quippe cum
non alias huic competit bonorum possessio, quam si lex specialiter deferat
bonorum possessionem' Dig. 38. 14. 1. 2.

Fora discussion oi the probable origin oi bonorum possessio, and oi
its development into an organized scheme of succession, see Excursus IV,
at the end os this Book. A little more is necessary in order to thoroughly
understand its nature.

ln order to obtain possession oi property belonging to the deceased,
the bonorum possessor had, as such, a special procedure, the interdici
Quorum bonorum (Dig. 43. 2. 1.-pr.‚ Gaius iv. 144), which had certain
advantages over the remedy available to the heres, quoheres (viz. here·
ditatis petitio, by which he established his title to the universitas iuris).
Thus, the interdict was never excluded by usucapio lucrativa (p. 221
supe: cs. Gaius ii. 52-58), and availed also against persons ‘qui dolo
desierant possidere :' hereditatis petitio was not thus privileged until the
time ol Hadrian, Dig. 5. 3. ao. 6-21, lb. 25. pr.-17. lt is then no matter
ior surprise that heirs‚ who had an unimpeachable civil title, applied ior
bonorum pnlssessio secundum tabulas in order to be ableto use the
interdict, ξ 1 supr, Gaius iii. 343 and similarly, as the heir could claim to

. become bonorum possessor, so the praetor treated the bonorum possessor
