sed placuit tantum emptionem et venditionem contrahi.

all cases, but only where the land belonged to the church ; 11 the landlord
was a lay person, writing was necessary only 11 and so sar as the parties
wished to modiiy the regulations oi the ordinary law as settled by those
two emperors, Cod. 4. 66. r, Now. 120. 6. 1.

t 4. The opinion ο1 Cassius had not many supportem in the time ol
Gaius, who says (iii. 147) ‘plerisque placuit emptionem et venditionem
contrahi! The true criterion in such cases is given by Javolenus in Dig.
18. 1. 65 ‘toties conductio alicuius rei est, quoties materia, in qua aliquid
praestatur, in eodem statu eiusdem permanet, quoties vero et immutatur,

puts the case os one letting out gladiators for the amphitheatre upon
terms that aspecified sum should be paid sor the services ο1 each who
came out ο1 the conflict unhurt, and a much larger one sor each who was
killed or disabled ; though ir was a moot point, he says the better opinion
was that it was hire sofar as the first contingency went, and sale so lar

use and take the iruits ο1 the res locata during the time agreed upon,
unless prevented by impossibility arising irom no fault os his own, in
which case he cannot demand the merces (Dig. 19. 2. 9. 3-43 ib. 19. 6),
though, 11 he has let a res aliena which its owner recovers from the con·
ductor by real action, he is liable to the latter in damages whether in
fault or not, Dig. ¹9· 2. 7-9. The thing again must be let in such a con·
dition that it can be used for the purpose agreed upon, Dig. ib. 19. 1 ; 11
there are defects oi which the locator was aware, he is liable in damageS,

to their importance. Burdens imposed by the law on the res locata itsell
