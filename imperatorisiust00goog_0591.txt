they assumed under the system of formulae, are described in Excursus X
inf. Under Justinian the term still denotes the plea by which a defendant
who cannot deny the existence of the plaintiffs right of action (ipso iure
actionem non habere) argues that it cannot be exercised with effect in
consequence of his possessinga countervailing right by which it is
balanced: ‘exceptio dicta est quasi quaedam exclusio, quae opponi
actioni cuiusque rei solet ad excludendum id quod in intentionem con·
demnationemve deductum est’ Dig. 44 1. 2. pr. But, besides losing its
old formal or processual meaning, as an clement in the formula, even
the old material signification of the term, as a plea in defence of a
countervailing right, has now become less prominent owing to a new
distinction which has arisen between defences which relate to the pro-
cedure, and defences which rather meet the plaintifl’s case upon its
merits. Among the former are objections touching the competence or
impartiality of the court, the person of the plaintiff (e. g. exceptio procu·
ratoria)‚ the form of the action, and the exceptio praeiudicii. These
must be advanced and argued before litis contestatio, the opening of the
case by narratio and contradictio, for if they are shown to be well
grounded the action cannot proceed. Defences of the second class,
whether they directly traverse the plaintiti's contention, or merely allege
a countervailing right in the defendant, need not be advanced till litis
contestatio ; the result of this being that the term exceptio is sometimes
improperly used to denote what is really an absolute denial of the
plaintiffs right; eg. exceptio non numeratae pecuniae in answer to an
alleged mutuum, Excursus VllI supr. ; and exceptio longi temporis after
ten or twenty years' bona fide possession by a defendant with iustus
titulus.

Dilatory exceptione (ξ ro inf.) belonging to this latter class of defences
must always be advanced at the litis contestatio, and any attempt to
bring thern forward for the first time at a later stage of the proceedings
was punished by a fine inflicted on the counsel, Cod 4. 19. 123 but no
evidence need be given in their support till the plaintifi' has proved his
own case: ‘exceptionem dilatoriam opponi quidem initio, probari vero
postquam actor monstraverit quod asseverat oportet' Cod, ib. 19. For the
general procedure see ξ ιο inf. and notes.

Peremptory exceptione (§ 9 ins.) also as a rule are advanced in the con·
tradictio, at the opening of the case, and similarly need not be proved
till the plaintiff has established his own contention, Cod. 7. 35 9 ; but the
defendant may always bring them forward later, and may even allege
them for the first time on appeal: ‘si quid autem in agendo negotio
minus se allegasse litigator crediderit, quod in iudicio acto fuerit omissum

gopud eum qui de appellatione cognoscit prosequatur' Cod. 7. 62. 6. 1 ; 7.
