EXCURSUS Ι.

caPtTts DEMINUTIO.

Urow the nature oi capitis deminutio minima a different view is
maintained by Savigny from that adopted in the note on Bk. i. 16. 3.
He argues that the essence oi all capitis deminutio is a degradation,
or ‘downward step on the ladder oi status? As applied to the two
higber modes (maxima and media) this theory is not out oi accord
with the sacts : there can be no doubt that a sree man who became a
slave, or a civis who became Latinus or peregrinus, was thereby
degraded to a lower civil position. As applied, however, to capitis
deminutio minima it presents insuperable difficulties: it is neither
established by the authorities, nor can the inferences which must
logically be drawn from it be reconciled with the statements ol the
jurists and other writers.

(ι) On Savigny’s hypothesis capitis deminutio minima occurred
only in two cases: (a) where a person sui iuris passed into potestas
or manus: (b) where a filiusfamilias, or woman in manu, was con·
veyed into the condition oi mancipium in order thereby to be emanci-
pated or given in adoption. Accordingly, tbe children osan adrogatus
will not be capite minuti when they pass along with him into the
potestas and familia os the adrogator: yet the very opposite ol this
is stated by Paulus in Dig. 4. 5. 3 ‘liberos qui adrogatum parentem
sequuntur placet minui caput, cum in aliena potestate sunt, etcum
familiam mutaverint! Savigny boldly says that Paulus was wrong,
that his view is unsupported by any other jurist, and is in fact
peculiar to himself: hut he seems to have overlooked the force ol
the word ‘placet' which certainly means ‘is the received doctrine’
(‘ verbum de iure antea controverso, iurisconsultorum responsis sta·
bilito, sollemne' Schrader), and it can hardly be doubted that it Paulus
had been stating his own individual opinion he would have said ‘ puto,’
or ‘videtur mihi! On this point Savigny is altogether unsupported
by textual authority.

(a) On Savigny's hypothesis a woman who passed in manum was
capite minuta only it she were sui iuris before the conventio in manum,
not if she were already in potestas. But this distinction is quite
