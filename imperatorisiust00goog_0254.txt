lietu] DE MILITARI TEST AMENT 0. 241

libus remissa est. nam quamvis hl neque legitimum numerum
restium adhibuerint neque aliam testamentorum sollemnitatem
observaverint, recte nihilo minus testantur, videlicet cum in
expeditionibus occupati sunt: quod merito nostra constitutio
induxit. quoquo enim modo voluntas eius suprema sive
scripta inveniatur sive sine scriptura, valet testamentum ex
voluntate eius. illis autem temporibus, per quae citra expe-
ditionum necessitatem in aliis locis vel in suis sedibus degunt,
minime ad vindicandum tale privilegium adiuvantur: sed
testari quidem et si filii familias sunt propter militiam con·

oi testamentary form dates from the time oi Julius Caesar. A soldiers
will (1) ii written, did not require to be witnessed at all: ἀμαρτύρους...

Leonis 40, though§ r, ‘convocatis ad hoc hominibusss might seem to
impIy the contrary : (a) ii oral, could not stand is the alleged heir was the
only witness, § 1. By the enactmenr to which be refers (Cod. 6. 21. 7)
Justinian allowed the exercise os this privilege by a soldier only while he
was in camp or barracks on actual service (this belng the meaning of
expeditio in the text), not while on iurlough: and a will so executed
remained in force only one year aiter his discharge, ξ 3ini, and even lost
all validity ii the discharge was ‘with ignomiuy!

lt was not merely in respect of torm that soldiers' wills were privileged.
They were not borum by the rule ‘nemo pro parte testatus, pro parte
intestatus decedere potest’ Tit. 14. 5 ins, or by the lex Falcidia and
similar enactments relating to fideicommissa: they need not ionnally
disinherit their children, Tit. 13. 6 int, Cod. 3. 29. 8, nor were their wills
avoided by their undergoing capitis deminutio (ξ 5 ini, Dig. 28. 3. 6. 6) r
they could institute as heirs pemeus who could not inherit from an
ordinary testator (Gaius ii. 110), and could dispose oi the inheritance by
codicils, Dig. 29.1. 36.

ibe wills oi certain other persons besides soldiers were privileged in
the matter oi form. By an enactment ol Justinian the general law might
in rural districts be overidden by local custom, and signature by the wit·
nesses was dispensed with ii it was difficolt to find seven who could write,
and even five were held enough ii more could not be got, Cod. 6. 23. 31.
Wbere a man disposed oi his property solely in favour oi his own de-
scendantshis will,ii written, need notbeattested (‘testamentum parentium
inter liberos' Nov. 107. ι).
