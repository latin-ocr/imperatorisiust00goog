‘tsignifrcari intellegimus, sed et fustes ct lapides. Tertia divisio
interdicturum haec est, quod aut simplicia sunt aut duplicia. ,
simplicia sunt, veluti inquibus alter actor, alter reus est:
qualia sunt omnia restitutoria aut exhibitoria: namque actor
est, qui desiderat aut exhiberi aut restitui, reus is, a quo de-
sideratur, ut restituat aut exhibeat. prohibitoriomm autem
interdictomm alia simplicia sunt, alia duplicia. simplicia sunt,
veluti cum prohibet praetor in loco sacro vel in flumine
publico ripaue eius aliquid fieri (nam actor est, qui desiderat,
nequid fiat, reus, qui aliquid facere conatur): duplicia sunt
veluti uti possidetis interdictum et utmbi. ideo autem du·
plicia vocantur, quia par utriusque litigatoris in his condicio
estnec quisquam praecipue reus vel acto'r intellegitur, sed
unusquisque tam rei quarn actoris partem sustinet.

possession of land or buildings from which a person had been violeutly
ejected (ad duas dissimiles res duo disiuncta interdicta sunt, Cic. pro
Caec. 32) 3 one, the ordinary interdict unde vi, applying where there had
been no use of weapons (vis quotidiana); the other, interdictum de vi
armata, where there had

lu the first case the ejector could plead the exceptio vitiosae pos·
sessionis, i. e. the grantee of the interdict was successful only if he could
show that he bad not himself obtained possession vi, clam, or precario
from the other (lex Thoria 7, Cic. pro Tullio 44-5, Gaius iv. 154). In
the second the mode in which his possession had originated was im·
material, Gaius iv. 155. This difference, however, as appears from the
text, had disappeared in Justinian’s time, possibly in consequence of
V alentinian’s enactment (Coti 8. 4. 7) here referred to, for which see on
Tit. 2. t supr. Originally too only the first uf these interdicts had been
subject to prescription in a year, Cic. ad Fam. 15, 16, but under Jus-
tinian this distinction too had ceased to exist, and there was only one
interdict de or unde vi, which could be brought after a year had elapsed
from the ejectment only su far as the ejector had been thereby enriched,
Dig. 43. 16. t. pr. and 39. Justinian allowed unde vi to be brought even
where land had been entered upon in the possessor's absence, Cod
8. 4. rr.

The limitation of this interdict to res immobiles (Paul. sent. rec. 5. 6.
5,Dig.43.16.1.6) seems to hold also under Justinian. The action
under the constitution of Valentinian (which applied also to moveables)
would be one of the actions which lay upon theft in addition to the actio
furti, Titf. 1. 19 and notes supr. For the lex lulia de vi see Tit. 18. 8 and
notes rn.

the formulary period see note p. 590 supr. Under Justinian they ure
