antiqui iuris altercationes placavimus: Latinos autem lunianos
et omnem quae circa eos suerit observantiam alia constitutione

per eiusdem quaestoris suggestionem correximus, quae inter
imperiales radiat sanctiones, et omnes libertos nullo nec aetatis
manumissi nec dominii manumissoris nec in manumissionis
modo discrimine habito, sicuti antea observabatur, civitate
Romana donavimus: multis additis modis, per quos p'ossit
libertas servis curn civitate Romana, quae sola in praesenti
est, praestari.

solenniter' the rights of Latinitas (General lntrod. p. 26 supe), whence
they were called Latini Iuniani. The Latinitas oi the Latini coloniarii
bad oonlerred the commercium without the connubium, i. e. the power
ol holding property and engaging in commerce under the peculiar forms
and protection of Roman law, and of making a testament valid iure
civili. But these rights were seriously curtailed, in the case οἰ Latini
luniani, by the lex lunia Norbana, which (Gaius i. 22-24U1pian, reg.
ao. 8) deprived them ol the privileges ol making a will, being named
testamentary guardians, and benefiting under the will oi another person.
Consequently, when a Latinus lunianus died, as he could have no suus
heres or agnate, his whole property went ‘ iure quodammodo peculii' to
his patron; Blr. iii. 7. 4 ini. Justinian repealed the lex lunia, and as to
the modes ol manumission to which it had related, he euacted that they
should make a slave a full citizen provided they were evidenced by live
witnesses3 Cod. 7. 6. The alii multi modi alluded to in ξ 1 are specilied
in the same constitution z among them are the formal designation nithe
slave by the master as his son, and the delivery to him of the docu-
ments by which his servitude could be proved. There were numerous
modes in which a Latinus could attain the civitas ; see Gaius i. 28-35, and
Mr. Poste’s notes.

The object ol the lex Aelia Sentia (Α. n. 4) was to throw obstacles in
the way ol inconsiderate manumissions‚ and to guard the state against
the dangers which might result from the bestowal os citizenship on
slaves os bad character and antecedents; it should thus be read in
close connection with the lex Fufia Caninia, Tit. 7 inf. Four os its pro·
visious concern us. (1) 1t enacted that slaves who had been guilty of
some serious crime, or subjected to some degrading treatment, if subse-
quently manumitted, should have only the same rights as dediticii, or
memies surrendered at discretiori ε ‘lege itaque Aelia Sentia cavetur, ut
qui servi a dominis poenae nomine vincti sint, quibusve stigmata in-
scripta sint, deve quibus ob noxam quaestio tormentis habita sit, et in
ea noxa fuisse convicti sint, quique ut {erro aut cum bestiis depugnarent
traditi sint, inve ludum custodiamve coniecti luerint, et postea vel ab
eodem domino vel ab alio manumissi, eiusdem conditionis liberi liant,
cuius conditionis sunt peregrini dediticii’ Gaius i. 1 a They could not
by any possibility rise to the status oi cives or even oi Latini ; the statute
