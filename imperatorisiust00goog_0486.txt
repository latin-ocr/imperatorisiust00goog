JOINT AND SEVERAL LIABIHTY. 473

by different obligations against two or more debtors, or one debtor
bound by different obligations to two or more creditors; but these
obligations, though different from one another, may have one and the
same object (act or forbearance): not similar objects, such as the
payment of the 101. penalty above, bnt the same object3 so that
when that object is once attaIned by the performance ol one os the
obligations, all the rest, no longer having any object, cease ipso lacto
to exist. E. g. A, B, and C jointly break my windows. Each is under
aseparate obligation to pay me ior mending them, and I may sue
which I please, apart from the rest, lor the expenscs to which I have
been put ; but ill recover the amount os the glazier's bill from A, 1
can no longer get it from B or C, for the claim is a civil one for com·
pensation, not a quasi-criminal one lor a penalty. In such a case,
there are as many separate obligations as there are debitores, but the

object os all these obligations is the same: each debtor is, therefore, v

liable sor the whole object, or liable in solidum (as distinct from the
liability pro parte exemplified by a joint promise to pay 152), but as
the object is only one, it can only be once attaincd, and therefore
performance by one ol the joint debtors releases the rest. This is
called solidary obligation: and as two or more debtors can be
solidarily bound to one creditor (passive solidarity), so two or more
creditors can be solidarily entitled against one debtor (active soli·
darity); i. e. either or any one of them can, without consulting the
other or rest, claim the whole object (which forms the connecting link
between the different obligations) from the single debtor 3 but as soon
as he lias done what he has to do lor one, the vinculum iuris between
him and all is severed, and he is free. The predominance ol passive ·
over active solidary obligationis so great that some writers have
supposed the latter to have no real existence. There is a clear case ol
it, however, in Dig. 9. 414. pr., though owing to its rareness we
need not concern ourselves with it here.

Cases ol the passive form are (1) the joint commission osa delict:
the obligation ol the codelinquents to make compensation (though
not to pay a penalty) is solidary, Dig. a. ιο. 1. 4. ; 4. a. 14. 15;
13. ι. r. (a) The liability ol cotutors for dolus and culpa in the dis
charge of their functions, Dig. 16. 3. 1. 43; 26. 7. 18. 1 ; 27. 3. r. 13·
(3) Where two or more persons jointly incur a contractual but not
correal (sor which see below) liability (e. g. A and Bjointly agree to
act as agents lor C, Dig. 17. r. 60. a ; or as his depositaries, Dig. 16.
3. 1. 43; or jointly borrow a thing sor use, Dig. 13. 6. 5. 15), they are
bound solidarily in respect of the duties which arise irom the contract
