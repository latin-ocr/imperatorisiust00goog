The principal consequences of mora debitoris areas follow ε

(ι) The debtor must compensate the creditor for the loss of all
advantage which he would have had if the act had been duly performed
(omnis causa), especially fruits, Dig. 22. 1. 38. 15, and interest, ib. 32. 2.
lf, however, the obligatlon was to pay certa pecunia, interest on mora
could not be claimed: see on Tit. 14. pr. supr. (2) After he is once in
mora, the debtor is not released by performance becoming impossible,
even without his fault, Dig. 12. 1. 3 ; ih other words, even though under the
contract he was liable for culpa lata only, he now becomes answerable not
only for culpa levis but also for casus ι and if the objectos the obligatinn
has become less valuable, he must pay the highest value it has had since
it became due, Dig, ra 3. 1 a t. (3) ln bilateral contracts the one party
can withdraw from the compact‚ if to accept performance after mora of
the other would seriously prejudice him: e. g. if possession of a farm is
not given to the lessee at the date agreed upon, and in the meanwhile he
has taken another, Dig. 19. 2. 24. 4. (4) lf it has been agreed that the
creditor’s right shall expire within a certain period, mora debitoris occur-
ring within that period cancels the agreement, Dig. 34 3. 3. 1 and 2.

Mora debitoris was ‘purged' by extinction of the obligation‚ by the
creditor's either expressly or tacitly granting him grace, and by the latter
tendering performance to the former, including compensation sor all loss
which the mora had entailed upon him.

The chief effects of mora creditoris were (1) that the debtor was released
by performance becoming impossible save through his own dolus or
culpa lata, Dig.18. 6. 16 and 18 ; in other words, he became answerable
for culpa lata only, even though previously answerable for culpa leris3
(a) that the creditor has to compensate the debtor for any loss which the
refusal to accept performance properly tendered entails upon him, Dig.
ro ι. 3. 4.

wit. XX. Under the older law suretyship could be contracted ‘verbis'
in two other ways, sponsio (spondesf spondeo) and fidepromissio (fide-
promittis? fidepromitto); but only debts incurred by stipulation could
be guaranteed by either of them. No one could be a sponsor except a
civis, and unless both the partios to the principal contract were cives
also, but these rules did not apply to fidepromissio. Both were obsoleto
under Justinian,but the following points in which they differed from fide·
iussio may be notieed:
