hac causa acciderit ei, contra quem plus petitum luerit, com·
missa tripli condemnatione, sicut supra diximus, puniatur.

Whether in integrum· restitutio propter dolum and metum was older
than these remedies, and was to a great extent superseded by thern,
as Savigny contends, is uncertain; at any rate it seems clear from Cic.
de off. 3. 14 that restitutio doli causa was unknown before the time oi

, Gallus Aquilius. lt is, however, certain that their concurrent existence

narrowed the operation ol the equitable relies on these two causae.

An instance ol restitutio propter errorem is supplied in the text above 3
the other cases ol its application suggest the conclusion that it was
almost entirely confined to laesiones incurred in the progress of an
action, though examples οἱ its occurrence in substantive law are lound in
Dig. 42. 6. 1. 17; 349 17.

Restitutio propter capitis deminutionem occurred only where the
capitis deminutio was minima: ‘pertinet hoc edictum ad eas capitis ·
deminutiones, quae salva civitate contingunt; ceterum sive amissione
civitatis, sive libertatis amissione contingat capitis deminutio, cessabit
edictum' Dig. 4 5. 2. pr. For its application see Blc iii. ro 3 aud notes
supr.

Persons who, while absent either rei publicae causa, or by reason oi
justiliable lear, or in captivity with a public enemy, lost rights ol
property or ol action could obtain restitution; and persons at home
could get themselves restituti against others who had obtained a pro·
prietary advantage (eg. by usucapio, ξ 5 supr.) or release from an action
while abroad or imprisoned.

The edict upon this subject terminated with the so·called generalis
clausula: ‘item si qua alia causa videbitur, in integrum restituam' Dig.
46. 11 ; ib. 26. 9 ; words apparently intended to include all cases, other
than those already specified, in which the realizatlon of a right was
prevented by obstacles ol lact rather than ol law.

(3) As a general rule, the case must be one in which the ordinary law
atiords no relies : ‘in causae cognitione etiam hoc versabitur, num forte
alia actio possit competere citra in integrum restitutio '3 nam si communi
auxilio et mero iure munitus sit, non debet ei tribui extraordinarium
‚ auxilium’ Dig. 4. 4 16. pr. But occasionally restitutio was merely an
alternative, e.g. to the actio doli, quod metus causa, tutelae (Dig. 4. 4 47.
1), and the bonae fidei actions, Cod. 2. 54. 33 4. 44. ς; ib. ro. There
are also a number ol other exceptions to its general application ; eg. no
one could claim restitutio against penal laws, against a patron or ascend·
ant, or against his own dolus.

(4) Restitutio must be applied lor within a period ol prescription fixed
originally at an annusutilis, and extended by justinian to a quadriennium
continuum (note on ξ 5 supr). lt is disputed from what moment prescrip·
tion began to rim; according to some this is (except in absentia and
minor aetas) the date ol laesio ; according to others, the termination oi
the causa. ·

The procedure in the formulary period was extra ordinem. The
