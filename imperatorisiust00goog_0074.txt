THE EARLIER CODES ΑΝῙ) COMPILATIONS. 61

to speak ol the legislation of Justinian, is that ol the codices con·
stitutionum, or compilations oi imperial ordinances, which spread them·
selues over about two and a·hall centuries. The first with which we
are acquainted is the codex Gregorianus, a collection ol constitutions
issued from the time, probably, ol Hadrian up to nn. 284, and prin-
cipallyrescripts os Septimius Severus and the emperors who succeeded
him. lts exact date is uncertain, hut it cannot well be placed earlier
than au. 295; its arrangement was based upon that ol the current
commentaries on the Edict. Another compilation os the same
character is the codex Hermogenianus, which may be regarded as an
appendix to the loregoing. The oldest constitution which it con·
taiued was issued un. 290 or 29¹3 the great majority of them belong
to Diocletian and Maximian (3.3. 284—305), though seven enacted
by Valens and Valentinian, about s.1>.365, are also referred to it ;
it this is correct, its composition must lie between su. 3⁶5 and au.
398, but there are civilians who place it many years beiore the earlier
oi these two dates, and accordingly deny that it could have com·
prised constitutions oi Valens and Valentinian. Both ol these codices,
so far as we know, were formed by private persons, that is to say,
not under the authority ol an imperial commission; they were in
coustant use both in the West and iu the East, and lost their im·
portance in the latter 13311 ο1 the empire only by being absorbed in
his own code by Justiniau.

The contents ol the so·called ‘Vatican fragments' are more mis·
cellaneous. They are portions ol a compilation oi excerpts from
juristic writings and imperial rescripts and edicts, and were first
published in 1823. The author is unknown, but the date ol the work
must be between nn. 372 and no. 438, lor it contains a constitution
issued in the first of these two years, and in the latter the Theodo-
sian code was published. The jurists whose works are most largely
laid under contribution are Papinian (responsa and quaestiones), Ul·
pian (libri ad edictum, etc.) aud Paulus (libri ad edictum, sententiae,
respousa, quaestiones, etc.); Celsus, Julian, and Pomponius are also
olten cited. The work seems to have had a purely practical pur·
pose, and was arranged in Titles subdivided into rubrics. Seven of
the Titles are extant, relatiug to the loliowing subjecta: (1) ex empto
et vendit03 (3) de usufructu; (3) de re uxoria et dotibus; (4) de
excusatione3 (5) quando donator intelligatur revocasse voluntatem 3
(6) de donationibus ad legem Cinciam3 (7) de cognitoribus et
