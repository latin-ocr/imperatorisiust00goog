iudicia ordinaria see Excursus X at the end of this volume, and Mr.
Poste's note on Gaius iii. 77. He adopts Savigny’s theory that there
were, from the first, two different modes os proceeding against insolvent
debtors: the one-manus iniectio or persona] execution—applying only
where the judgment or confession on which execution issued was on a
money loan, real (mutuum) or fictitious (nexum) oron certain other
obligations assimilated by statute to mutuum, Gaius iv. ²23 the other, or
execution against the property, being resorted to in all other cases. A
commonet view is that, until about roo 13.c.,manus iniectio (though its
severities were mitigated by the lex Poetelia, Livy viii. 28) was the only
remedy open to a creditoris his debtor refused or was unable to satisly
a judgrnent debr ; about which time a new form of execution against the
property, or real execution, was introduced by the Edict, ol which a
leading feature was sale os the bankrupt’s universitas iuris by auction to
the bidder who offered the creditors the highest percentage on their
claims, this praetorian form ol bankruptcy execution being called bonorum
emptio or venditio, and being described by Gaius (iii. 77-81) as one ol
the kinds ol universal succession.

lhough it is difficolt to come to any definite conclusion on so obscure
a topic, the latter view seems best supported by the facts, apart from its
inherent probability on grounds ol historical jurisprudence. Savigny has
to prove two positions: first, that personal execution was confined to
the classes of debts specified; and second, thara system ol real execu-
tion was in vogue at Rome from the earliest times.

ln support ol the former he calls attention to what seems an un·
deniable lact, viz. that the Romans always drew a broad distinction
between debts incurred by money loans and all other debts, and cites
various authors (e. g. Gellius 20. 1, quoting the Twelve Tables, and Livy vi.
14, viii. 28, xxiii. 14) to show that manus iniectio is almost invariably
associated with debts ol the first kind On the other hand, we have the
explicit statement ol Gaius (iv. 21) that it was the proper procedure on
every judgment debr, however incurred. Savigny, however, relies most
on chaps. 21 and 22 os the lex Rubria or lex Galliae Cisalpinae, in which
it is provided that when an action is brought lor pecunia certa credita,
manus iniectio shall be employed: when on any other liability, another
procedure may be resorted to-‘eos duci, bona eorum possideri iubeto!
On his interpretation, this means that, lor pecunia certa credita, the
execution must be personal, while in other cases it must be real; but it
is sar more natural to suppose that, except for money lonas, the statute
