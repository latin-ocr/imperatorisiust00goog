Tit. 1.] DE RERUM DIVISIONE. 185

Nullius autem sunt res sacrae et religiosae et sanctae: quod
enim divini iuris est, id nullius inbonis est. Sacra sunt, quae 7
rite et per pontifices deo consecrata sunt, veluti aedes sacrae8
et dona, quae rite ad ministerium dei dedicata sunt, quae
etiam per nostram constitutionem alienari et obligari pro·
hibuimus, excepta causa redemptionis captivorum. si quis
vero auctoritate sua quasi sacrum sibi constituerit, sacrum
non est, sed profanum. locus autem, in quo sacrae aedes
aedificatae sunt, etiam diruto aedificio adhuc sacer manet,
utet Papinianus scripsit. Religiosum locum unusquisque9

‘· posed: so that legal relations can subsist between it 3ηά them and any
number ol them no less than between it and other persons generally.
Such corporations may be exemplified by the state (Dig. 49. 14, Cod.
10. ι), ecclesiastical bodies (Dig. 28. 3. 6. 7), 3ηά commercial associations,
‘collegia pistorum, labrorum,' etc. (Dig. 3. 4 r. pr.)

Universitates bonorum are juristic persons not necessarily supported
by any natural person: they are so much property, or masses ol rights
3ηά duties (Giiterinbegrifl) personified and regarded as capable os per·
petuating their separate existence and fictitious unity indefinitely, eg.
the treasury orfiscus: foundations such as churches‚ hospitals, 3ηά
almshouses : hereditates iacentes, i.e. inheritances on which no heir has
yet entered, and the ‘estate' or universitas iuris ol a citizen lying in cap·
tivity with the enemy, Dig. 3. 5. 19. 5. Savigny's dictum as to the origin
os corporations (which is stated by Mr. Poste, Gaius p. 156) seems
untrue in the lace ol Dig. 34. 5. 20, from which it may be argued that
persons could always incorporate themselves lor lawlul purposes without
the special assent os the sovereign.

Η. When it is said that res sacrae, religiosae, and sanctae are res
nullius, what is meant is rather that they were nullius in bonis, i.e. extra
patrimonium. Res nullius, in the more technical sense, are those things

which ‘liunt singulorum’ by occupatio, §§ 12-18 inl.

58. Res sacrae could become so only by being dedicated under
public authority by a priestly ceremony (sor which in the pagan time see
Cic. pro domo 47, Ovid, Fast. 1. 610, Valer. Max. 5. ιο) in the later
period the imperial sanction seems to have been sufficient, Dig. 5. 3.
5ο. 1 3 ιι. 7. 8. pr. By consecration they ceased to be in commercio 3ηά
became inalienable, though in Justinian’s time moveable res sacrae
might be sold sor the purpose mentioned in the text (cl. Gregor. ep.
6.13, Socrates, trist. eccl. 7. 21) and also for the support os the poor
in time ot famine, 3ηά for payment os the debts of the church, Cod.
1. 2. 21, Nov. 120. 10. ll sacred ground was captured by the enemy, it
became profanum, though by a kind os postliminium it could recover its
tormer character, Dig. rr. 7. 36.

50. Gaius (it 4) describes res religiosae as things ‘quae dis manibus
