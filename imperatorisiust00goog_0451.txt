stantum gratia intercedit mandatum. Tua gratia intervenit
mandatum, veluti si tibi mandet, ut pecunias tuas potius in
emptiones praediorum colloces, quam feneres, vel ex diverso
ut feneres potius, quam in emptiones praediorum colloces.
cuius generis mandatum magis consilium est quam mandatum,
et ob id non est obligatorium, quia nemo ex consilio mandati
obligatur, etiamsi non expediat ei cui dabitur, cum liberum
cuique sit apud se explorare, an expediat consilium. itaque
si otiosam pecuniam domi te habentem hortatus fuerit aliquis,
ut rem aliquam emeres vel eam credas, 'quamvis non expediet
tibi eam emisse vel credidisse,‘non tamen tibi mandati tenetur.
et adeo haec ita sunt, ut quaesitum sit, an mandati teneatur
qui mandavit tibi, ut Titio pecuniam fenerares: sed optinuit
Sabini sententia obligatorium esse in hoc casu mandatum,
quia non aliter Titio credidisses, quam si tibi mandatum esset.

very fact that it is mandatum, and not constitutum or fideiussio. Thus,
the mandator is liable even though owing to incapacity in the third party
no principal obligation is established between the latter and the man-
datarius, Dig. 44 13. pr.; he can save himself by revolring the com·
mission so long as it has not yet been acted ou,§ 9 int, Dig. 17. 1. 12. 16,
and the commission itself is revoked by the mandators death 3 payment
by him does not release the principal debtor, Dig. ib. 28, nor did an
action brought by mandatarius against mandator or the third party
release the other, as formerly was the case with sureties by verbal
obligation‚ note on ξ 2 supr. ; the mandator, even after having paid the'
mandatarius, can get an assignment of the latter's right of action against
the debtor, the debt not being extinguished as it would be in the case of
a fideiussor (see on Tit. 20.4 supr.); and, finally, the mandator himself
has an action against the mandatarius if the latter accepted the com·
mission and then did not properly execute it, Dig. 17. 1. 6. 4

§a So strongly was it felt, Justinian says, that a mandatum tua
tantum gratia created no obligation‚ that people even extended tbe
doubt to those which were for the benedt of a third person as well as of
yourself: especially as it seems not improbable from Dig. 17. 1. 6. 4
(cited on 3 supr.) that a mandate aliena tantum gratia was also originally
held to be void. Sometimes a person incurred a liability to compensate
in case of loss accruing to the other party even upon amere consilium ;
e. g. where by special contract he expressly undertook responsibility for
his advice, and where the advice was given with evil intent, for tbe very
purpose of damaging the other: ‘consilii non fraudulenti nulla obligatio
est: ceterum si dolus et calliditas intercessit, de dolo actio competit'
Dig. 42. 1. 47. pr. : cf. the text, ‘nemo ev¹ consilio mandati tenetur.³
