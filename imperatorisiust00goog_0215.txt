ritur tibi proprietas perinde ac si eo nomine tradita fuisset.
saltem si quis merces in horreo depositas vendiderit, simul
atque claves horrei tradiderit emptori, transfert proprietatem
46 mercium ad emptorem· Hoc amplius interdum et in incertam
personam collocata voluntas domini transfert rei proprie-
tatem: ut ecce praetores vel consules, qui missilia iactant in
vulgus, ignorant, quid eorum quisque excepturus sit, et tamen,
quia volunt quod quisque exceperit eius esse, statim eum
47 dominum efficiunt. Qua ratione verius esse videtur et, si
rem pro derelicto a domino habitam occupaverit quis, statim
eum dominum effici. pro derelicto autem habetur, quod do-
minus ea mente abiecerit, ut id rerum suarum esse nollet,
idideoque statim dominus esse desinit. Alia causa est earum
rerum, quae in tempestate maris levandae navis causa eici-
untur. hae enim dominorum permanent, quia palam est eas
non eo animo eici, quo quis eas habere non vult, sed quo
magis cum ipsa nave periculum maris effugiat: qua de causa

§ 45. The keys must be delivered apud horrea, Dig. 18. 1. 74: in prae·
sentia, Dig. 41. a. 1. 21. Many commentators regarded traditio of the
keys as a symbolical traditio of the contents of the building, in the same
way as the handing over the keys of a town to a king on his entry sym·
bolised the surrender of the town itself. But Savigny has shown (Pos-
session ᾗ 14) that what is essential is not so much the transfer of the
thing itselfas the enabling of the transferee to exercise exclusive control
over it ; cf. Cic. Philipp. 2. 28.

ξ 46. The case put in the text is a genuine traditio : for the transferee
is intended, though indefinitely: the transferor contemplates somcbody
or other in the crowd before him as the receiver. But in the next para·
graph the circumstances are different; the person who may take pos-
session of the res derelicta is absolutely uncertain, and does not conceive
the abandonment as made in his favour at all.

§42 For dereliction see on§ 12 supr. The opinion that the prior
ownership ceased immediately with the abandonment, confirmed here by
Justinian, had been that of the Sabinians; the Proculian school con·
strued the act of abandonment as one which made acquisition of owner-
ship by occupatio possible, but divested the owner of his property only
when the occupatio had supervened‚ Dig. 41. 7. 2. 1. Observe that to
get rid of one's dominium an overt act (abiecerit) is requisita besides
intention (nollet) ; to lose possession it was different: ‘dominium nihilo-
minus eius manet, qui dominus essenon vult: possessio autem recedit’
Dig. 41. 1. 17. 1. The mere finding of property gave no title, Dig. 6. 1.
67, and appropriation of it was theft, Dig. 47. 2. 43. 4
