IURA IN RE ALIENA OT HER THAN SERVITUDES. 315

entitled to evict him is he allowed the condition of the land to dete-
riorate,Nov.1ao8. From payment oi his rent he was exempted
only by complete destruction oi the land (Bk. iii. 24. 3 ini, Cod.
4. 66. 3). Should he propose to aell his interest, the dominus had,
within two months, a right ol pre-emption (ius sperandam) at the
price agreed upon: the person of the alienee had to be approved by
the latter, who, however, could only r'eluse his sanction on reasonable
grounds. The modes in which emphyteusis arose are identical with
those sor the creation ol superficies, and the doubt as to the admissi·
bility oi usucapio applies to both. ·

The mention os pignus, the last of the three iura in re aliena which
are not servitudes, makes this the most convenient place ior discussing
the different forms which pledge or mortgage took in Roman law.
The object ol pledge is to give a creditor a real security in addition
to the persoual security ol his debtor. If the creditor relies for
sadslaction oi his debt solely on a general belief in his debtor's ability
aad willingness to meet his liabilities, he contente himself with a per·
sonal security, and ilthe debtor’s assets prove insufficient, he must
pro muto be a loser: but is by any means he obtains rights over some
definite portion of the debtor's property, to which he can resort in
the event of non-payment, his security is real, ‘quia expedit ei pignori
potius incumbere quam in personam agere’ Bk. iv. 1.14inl. Real
security, in short, is a means of protecting a creditor against the risk
of the debtor's insolvency: sor creditors who are only ‘personally’
secured have no rights against the specific property to which the
‘really' secured creditor can resort until the latter has been paid in
fult Bearing this in mind, it is clear that that form of real security
is the most satisfactory which, while it absolutely secures the creditor,
causes the least inconvenience in other ways to the parties concerned.
It is important to obserwe how far these conditions respectively are
satisfied by the different forms of real security known to the Roman
lawyers, and also how lar these themselves belong to the department
ol iura in re aliena.

The earliest sorm was that known as fiducia, a term which here
bears the same meaning as in connection with deposit, mancipation,
and coemption, the general idea being that os a conveyance under an
agreement os trust, whereby the transieree is laid under an obligation
to deal with the person or property conveyed to him in a particdlar
manner. The aim ol real security was obtained hythe debtor's
oonveying specific property (it res mancipi, by mancipation, il nec
mancipi, by in iure cessio) to the creditor, upon terma that the latter
