legislation: ‘et hoc non primum a nobis dictum est, sed ab antiqua
descendit prosapia, quum etipse Iulianus, legum et edicti perpetui
subtilissimus conditor, in suis libris hoc retulit, ut, siquid imper·
sectum inveniatur, ab imperiali sanctione hoc repleatur; et uon ipse
solus, sed et divus Hadrianus, in compositione edicti et senatos con·
sulto, quod eam secutum est, hoc apertissime definivit, ut si quid
in edicto positum non inveniatur, hoc ad eius regulas eiusque con-

iecturas et imitationes possit nova instruere auctoritas' (justinian in
Const ‘tanta’ de Confinn. Digest ξ ι8).

The mention oi the responsa prudentium among the sources ol the
ius civile makes it necessary to speak oi the work done by the jurist
class in the development os Roman law; and as it was to the
jurists that that law owed what scientific lorm it possessed, besides
many ol its other special merita, it will not be amiss to discuss this
subject with some iullness The names ol the early prudentes who
lived under the free Republic are collected by Pomponius in Dig. r.
a. a. 35-39 ; the first is that oi Papirius, whose compilation os the leges
regiae has been already noticed. These earliest lawyers arc styled
prudentes not because their knowledge oi the law was more scientific,
less empirical‚ than that of other men, but rather because they knew it
more fully ; a philosophical treatment ol law had not yet commenced,
and such distinction as there was between their legal knowledge and
that os the ordinary citizen was quantitative rather than qualitative.
The first condition oi their existence asa professional class was the ces·
sation oi the pontifices to be ‘iuris conditores,' and the liberation ol pri-
vate law from the letters of the ius sacrum; it hasbeen suggested that
this was ellected in the main by the incorporation oi the plebeian element
in the state. The direction ol their legal activity is denoted by Cicero
(de Orat. i. 48) by the four terms respondere, cavere, agere, and scrihere.
Respondere expressed the delivery ol opinions (⁴ iuris civilis scientiam
publice profiteri ⁸) when consulted by either judges or private persons;
cavere, the advising more definitely on legal matters, such as the proper
mode os concluding some transaction, or of enlorcing a right in the
courts; agere, the actual participation in the process as patronus, or
by presently superintending a legal disposition 3 scribere, the dralting
oi technical documenta in proper legal phrase, the more mechanica}
partos the labour being perhaps undertaken by clerks or secretaries
But the most prominent os their functione, the capacity in which the
ordinary citiuen had most frequent occasion to consult them, was as
advisers on the practice os the law. The ordinary citizen could not
be acquainted with the complicated iorms ol procedure, or master the
