of the praetors order ς the dispossessed party brought the other at once
again before the magistrate, and here, in iure, the proper steps were
taken for getting the real question at issue between them decided by
action.

Tbe first of these was to determine which of them should have
possession of the object in dispute pending litigation, and this was done
by putting such interim possession up to auction between thern (fructus
licitatio): the one who bid the highest sum obtained it, subJect to the
'condition of paying that amount to the other, in case he lost the suit,
as liquidated damages for having been in possession of property to
which he had no right during the continuance of the action. Payment
of this was secured by a ‘fructuaria stipulatio,’ upon which the other
could sue by condictio ; or, as an alternative, he could bring a ‘iudicium
fructuarium' on the fructus licitatio itself

So far provision had been made only for compensating the party who
was out of possession for the loss which be sustained in being deprived
of it pending litigation, supposing he could prove that of right it belonged
to him For recovering the possession itself he bad a iudicium secu-
torium or Cascellianum, which was an actio arbitraria, enabling the
judge to condemn the party in possession to pay the value of the property
in dispute in default of restitution‚ Gaius iv. 165, 166.

N one of these proceedings‚ however, provided for the trial of the real
question at issue: they presupposed its decision in favour of the lower
bidder at the fructus licitatio, 3ηά were designed to enable him in that
event to reeover the possession and damages for having been awhile
deprived of it. The real question—which of the parties was, at the issue
of the interdici, entitled in law to the possession (Gaius iv. 166), was
brought to trial in the form of a wager, or rather of two wagers, as each
party played a double rtile. Now in Roman law a wager or a bet could
be made only by two stipulations, each of which 'was ground for an
independent aetion: the first party promised the second so much, if he
turned out to be in the wrong; and then the second promised the first
the same sum in the contrary event. Thus the double interdict, in·
volving two wagers, involved four stipulations and four condictiones
certi upon them; and formulae were delivered to the iudex for the
simultaneous trial of six actions, via (a) four condictiones certi on the
two wagers ; (b) a fifth condictio certi on the fructuaria stipulatio (or, as
alternative, the iudicium fructuarium); and (c) an actio arbitraria, the
iudicium secutorium. lf the iudex found in favour of the highest bidder
at the fructus licitatio, he absolved him on (b), (c), and the two wager-
condictions in which he was defendant, and condemned the other in the
two wager·condictions in which he was plaintifi: if he found against
him, he condemned him to pay the two wagers, the sum of the fructuaria
stipulatio, and the value of the property in default of restitution3 the
other party he absolved altogether; Gaius iv. 167, 168.
