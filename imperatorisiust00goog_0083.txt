under the head of applied (as distinct from pure) family law. Secondly,
the relation of the law of inheritance or succession to the classifioetion
so far suggested is by no means clear. lf, however, we ask what is
comprised in the idea of an inhesitance, the reply must be, the relations
ol the deceased person in the departments of ownership and obliga·
tion, or. as the Romans significantly expressed it, his universitas
iuris; his successor takes his property, and has to pay his debts
The law of succession is thus a division of the law of property, but its
importance in all legal systema forbids our making it a merely subor-
dinate division. Rather, we should divide the latter into simultaneous
and successive property law; the former comprising the law of things
and the law of obligations, the latter the law of inheritance.

The field of private law then comprises five great departments :-

ἰ. Pure family law, including marriage, parental power, kinship, and
the relation of guardian and ward.

ii. Applied family law.

iii. The law ol' things, under its three main heads os owncrship,
possession, and iura in re aliena.

iv. The law of obligations.

v. The law ol inheritance.

It must not be supposed that this is the classification of the Roman
lawyers3 it is one which Savigny arrives at by an a pnirrr' method,
and, so far as we know, there was not one among the prudentes who
in his systematic writings arranged his subJ'ect-matter upon this prin·
ciple. The reason why the outlines of Savigny's system have been so
fully considered is, partly, to suggest to the readcr an altemative
classification to that of the analytica] school, partly to show bow com
plete the institutes of Justinian, and their model the Commentaries of
Gaius, are in their material if not in their formal treatment of private
law. Marriage, parental power, kinship, and guardianship are treated
with great fuluess in Book i. Applied family law forms no compact,
independent part of the work, but is found, to some extent, distributed
among the other departments Thus, though dos is not explicitly
treated, donatio propter nuptias is discussed as one of the forms of
gift in Book ii. Title 7. The capacity of a filiusfamilias (a) to own
property independently of his pater is noticed in Book ii. Titles 9. rr,
and 12; (b) to bind his pater by his contracts in Book iv. Title γε
his position in respect of delict is the subject of Title 8 in the same
book; the relation of patron and freedman, though only with reference
to the former’s rights of succession to the latter, is treated in Book iii.
