with those of stipulation and Real contract, are tersely noticed. Sale
is considered in Title ²33 the principles relating to the moment at
which the contract is held to be concluded, the necessity of the price
being fixed and in money, and the ‘perieulum rei,' are clearly set
forth, together with one or two changes made in the law by Justinian

himself, and an incidental notice of a subject touched upon elsewhere “

relations. Locatio conductio, or hire, is discussed upon much the
same lines in Title 24, and in Title 25 are described the chief forms
of partneiship, the relations of partners inter se, and the modes in
which this contract is determined. Title 26 is upon the subject of
agency, the species of which are classified according to the variations
in the persons benefued by the agent’s commission; the modes in
which that commission terminares, and tlte reciprocal duties of agent
and principal, are also noticed. The question which is of so much ,

illustrated in Title 27 by negotiorum gestio, indebiti solutio, joint

may use that expression to indicate the aggregate of actionable
agreements—is somewhat misleading. lt must not be supposed
thatin the time of Justinian, or even of Gaius, no agreement was
ground to support an action which was neither expressed in the form
of stipulation, nor belonged to one or other of the classes of Real and
Consensual contracts. There had been 3 considerable advance in
two directions since the time when usage had restricted the term
‘contract' to denote the four classes of agreement enumerated in
Title ¹3· Between the establishment of the Empire and the age of
the last great classical jurists the principle of the Real contracts had
received 3 great development by the recognition of the rule, that
where one party to any bilateral agreement whatsoever had performed
what he had undertaken, he had always 3 remedy by action to enforce
performance by the other. This great group of socalled ‘innominate'
