Impossibilis condicio in institutionibus et legatis nec non in 10
fideicommissis et libertatibus pro non scripto habetur. Si plures 11
condiciones institutioni adscriptae sunt, siquidem coniunctim,
ut puta ‘si illud et illud factum erit,' omnibus parendum est:

si separatim, veluti ‘si illud aut illud factum erit,’ cuilibet
obtemperare satis est.

Hi, quos numquam testator vidit, heredes institui possunt. 12
veluti si fratris filios peregri natos ignorans qui essent heredes
instituerit: ignorantia enirn testantis inutilem institutionem
non facit. '

fulfils the condition, and becomes at once entitled to the inheritance, by
giving security that if he breaks the condition he will transfer the estate
to those entitled next after him (cautio Muciana). And even any one
conditionally instituted could, before the fulfilment of the condition,
obtain provisional bonorum possessio from the praetor by giving the
same security, Dig. 37. 11. 5. pr.; 2. 8. 12. lf he did not avail himself of
-this privilege, and the condition was one whose fulfilment was entirely
within his own control (e. g. si servum suum manumiserit), the creditors
of the estate could get a limit of time fixed within which he must fulfil
the condition or forfeit his right, Dig. 28. 5. 23. r: if the condition was
not of this kind (e. g. si Titius consul factus erit) the creditors could
obtain a grant of possessio of the inheritance, and pay themselves from
the proceeds of its sale, Dig. ib. 23. 2.

510. Impossible conditions are those which cannot be fulfilled
either (1) on natural grounds (physically impossible, e. g. Bk. iii. πᾳ 11),
or (2) on jural grounds (‘ veluti sororem nupturam sibi aliquis stipulatur'
Dig. 45. r. 35. 1): turpes (immoral) condiciones are treated in the sante
way as those which cannot legally be performed Dig. 28. 7. r 5. A
further distinction is that between conditions which are absolutely or
obiectively impossible, and those which are only relatively impossible3
hythe latter being meant such as might have been performed under
other circumstances, but which under existing circumstances cannot:
eg. release of a non-existent debt, or manumission of a slave who is
dead. Between these, however, and those which are objectiveiy impos·
sible there is, in general, no difference of treatment or effect: Dig. 28.
5. 4 5; ib. 7. ⁶3 Savigny, System iii. p. 165. Α contract made subiect
to an impossible condition was void, Bk. iii. ¹9· r1 inf: the Procnlians
had maintained the same of testamentary dispositious‚ but the Sabinians
held that an impossible condition in a will ought to be taken pro non
scripto, though Gaius himself (iii. 98) admitted the nnreasonableness of
the distinction between wills and contracta, which nevertheless was con·
firmed by justinian. A condition whose fulfilment becomes impossible
only after the making of the will does not come within the mle, Dig. 45.
