concessum' Ulpian, reg. 5. 4). After Caracalla (211-217 Ab.) had con·
ferred the civitas on all free subjects of the empire, of course absence of
connubium was rather the exception than the rule.

Apart from this, the general conditions of marriage were as follow.
(1) Certain persons were absolutely incapable of marriage, viz. slaves,
castrati, persons below the age of puberty, those already married, and
women whose husbands had not yet been dead a certain time fixed by
law. (2) The parties must not stand within certain degrees of relation·
ship to one another, §§ 1-11 inf, and must (3) themselves consent to the
marriage: ‘nuptias non concubitus sed consensus facit' Dig. 23. 2. 3o
(4) They must, if alieni iuris, have the consent os the persons in whose
power they are: cf. with this paragraph Dig. 23. 2.2 ‘nuptiae consis·
tere non possunt, nisi consentiant omnes, id est, qui coeunt, quorumque
in potestate sunt! F or exceptional cases, in which the parents' consent
was required for the marriage even of emancipated daughters, see Livy
4. 9, Cod. 5. 4. 1, 18. 20. (5) Marriage was forbidden by positive law
between the members of certain ranks or orders of society: e. g. between
ingenuus and infamis, between senators and liberti, members of the
dramatic profession, etc, by the lex,lulia et Papia Poppaea Other
enactments of a similar kind were made by Constantine, Cod 5. 27. r,
Leo and Anthemius (N ov. Anthem. 1), and Justinus, Cod. 5. 4. 23. On
the religious ground marriage was forbidden between Jew and Christian,
and on account ol official relation between the praeses and his pro·
vincial subjects, between the tutor and his female ward, etc. (6) Persons
convicted of adultery with one another might not subsequently marry
(Νον. 134. 14), and the same rule applied in cases of abduction, Cody
24. 1, Nov. ¹43· ¹50·

Marriage was contracted merely by consent, and no form was pre·
scribed by law. It is true that in the earlier period marriage was
usually accompanied by manus, which, as we have seen, was not corn·
pletely obsolete even in the time of Gaius; but the former was independent
of the latter, which was superimposed on it by some additional ceremony
or fact—confarreatio, coemptio, or usus. The agreement to marry was
usually entered into by mutual promises (sponsalia), originally made by
sponsio and restipulatio, Dig. 23· 1. a, asorm which would always sup·
port an action, so that we may believe that (in an indirect way) the
action for breach of promise of marriage was not unknown to the early
Romans ; i. e. though they never allowed a direct action on the promise
to marry, they allowed the stipulation ofa penalty in case of breach, and
this could be recovered. finally, however, even this indirect form of
compulsion came to be deemed contra bonos mores, and hythe intro·
duction of an exceptio doli even the exaction of the penalty was pre-
vented, Dig. 45. 1.134; and from this time onward the betrothal hy
stipulation seems to have been discontinued in favour os an informal en·
gagement, and the principle vas established, sufficit nudus consensus ad
