Such joint contracts will not, however, in themselves create active
solidary obligation‚ Dig. 16. 3. 1. 36 ; ib. 14. pr. (4) ln mandatum
qualificatum (Β). iii. 26. 5) joint mandators incur solidary liability il

the debtor is unable to pay himself, Dig. 46. 1. 5²· 13: so too witb
constitutum debiti alieni (note on Blr. iii. ao. 8). (5) Where one
room isjointly occupied by two or more persons they are liable in
solidum to the actio de effusis et deiectis, Bk. iv. 5. 1 inlr, Dig. 9.
3.1. 10; ib. 2-4.

Solidary obligation is terminated—i.e. all the solidary debtors
are released, and the right ol all tbe solidary creditors is extin-
guished— by simple satisfaction oi the sole creditor, or by satis·
laction ol one ol the creditore hythe single debtor. This may
occur (r) by performance, solutio, or (a) by set-off extending to
the whole ol the debt. But acquittal of one solidary debtor in
an action brought on his obligation did not release the rest lrom
theirs: ‘plures eiusdem pecuniae mand-atores, si unus iudicio eligatur,
absolutione quoque secuta non liberantur, sed omnes liberantur pecunia
soluta' Dig. 46. r. 25. 3. Acceptilatio (Bia iii. 29. ι) was equally
inoperative, for it is neither payment nor equivalent to it: and novatio
(ib. § 3) extinguished solidary liability only so lar as the object ol the
new obligation was quantitatively equivalent to that of the old, Cod.
a. 4. r. In short, the interventiones any event, which ordinarily
destroys an obligatior, between the creditor and one ol the joint
debtors, or between the debtor and one oi the joint creditore, does
not affect the liability ol the other debtors, or tbe right of the other
creditors‚ unless it is or amounts to performance. '

But, though the ultimate liability ol each ol several solidary debtors
for the whole object oi the obligations is clear, each ordinarily enjoyed
the following rights: (a) except where he had been guilty ol dolus, or
ol culpa in excess ol the rest, he could claim to be primarily sued
only lor an aliquot part ol the debt: he could be called upon to pay
more only il the rest or some ol thern were insolvent (beneficium
divisionis). (b) Ii another or others ol the debtors had been exces-
sively in lault, he could in some cases (e. g. cotutors, Dig. 26. 7. 3. a)
demand that he or they should be sued belore him (beneficium ordinis
sive excussionis). (c) Where he had not been guilty oi dolus (Dig.
27. 3. 1. 14) and paid the whole, he had a ius regressus against the
rest by which he could recover their respective shares oi what he had
pald In (ι) supr. this right ol course did not exist: ‘in pari delicto
potior est condicio defendentis!

From solidary we have to distinguish what is called correal obliga·
