the effect which the Stoic philosophy had upon legal method. Scae·
vola, the first great lawyer of the School, was also the first Roman
who wrote a systematic legal treatise; and itis to the habits os thought
which the profession acquired with its tenets that we should ascribe
not only the systematis classification, the mapping out os the held of
private law, bequeathed to us by Gaius, but also the uealth of Roman
law in legal principles, and the admirable logic of their subordination
and interconnection ¹.

It was in some such way as this that the Romans came to recognise
in the ius naturale or ius gentium an universal law binding on thern·
selves, and to say oi it, as Cicero does (de offic. iii. ιγ) ‘quod civile
non idem continuo gentium, qnod autem gentium, idem civile (ie.
civium) esse debet! Notwithstanding, however, the lact that the ius
gentium was constantly being absorbed into the system through the
edictos the praetor urbanus, the ius civile still retained its peculiari-
ties ; the streams ol the two did not intermingle, so that the contrast
between civil and praetorian law from this time onward becomes em·
phasised. The result was very similar to that which ensued upon the
incorporation of the plebs in the Roman state, namely, a duplication
os institutions. Whether it be in the domain oi the family, of property,
or of obligations, the legal institutions of Rome are henceiorward
found to a large degree in duplicate, institutions of the ius gentium
existing side by side with institutions os the ius civile. The thorough·
ness of this is perhaps best attested by the prominence, in all depart-
ments ol the code, of the opposition between ‘the natural' and ‘the
civil! Thus, the conditions os marriage depend upon either civilis or
naturalis ratio (lust. i. ro pr.)r: there ia a natural as distinct [roma
civil relationship‚ and the history ol the law os intestate succession is
merely the history os the substitution of the former title for the latter
by equity, as represented first by the praetor, and later by the imperial
legislation; there are both natural and civil modes os acquisition in
the two fields os ownership and obligation; there is natural as well as
civil possession, natural as well as civil obligation.

In many cases the rules os the edict differed in form only lrom those
os the civil law ; in substance they were the same. But the vast ma·
jority of them are distinct in kind as well as in sorm; they have none oi
