division into persons, things, and actions, and to ascertain its relatio
to other arrangements ol private law, such as those oi Savigny (Gene ι
Introduction, p. 67 sq, supr.) or ol Austin and his school.

Our only business here is to ascertain what Gaius and Justi 7.
intended by ‘ius quod ad personas pertinet' It seems clear that th-
only method by which this can be done is the analytical. Austin, it 1·
to be regretted, set in England the example ο1 pursuing a ‘hig
a priori road' in connection with this matter; the principal form ο
which is to adopt, as the leading division of law, that into ‘the law o
persons' and ‘the law ol things,' though in a sense differing consider
ably lrom that in which it was understood by the Roman lawyers, arr·
then either to lind fault with the latter lor not having meant the sama
as the writer, or to imply that they really meant the same thing
though owing to the weakness of their legal philosophy they did no
adhere with any consistency to their own principle, and thereby com
mitted most egregious laults of classification. Even if this be true, i
is probably a worse iault still to talre a classical expression (such ι·
‘law of persons,' which to its authors, we may surely believe, mean
something perfectly precise), give it a new signification withou
lrankly confessing that a liberty has been taken ς and then to irresist
ibly suggest that the two meanings are the same, if the authors of tha
expression really meant anything by it at all To an English read
the greatest difficulty, in the effort to understand the arrangement o
Gaius and Justinian, arises from Austin's perversion of the expressio·
‘law ol persons’ and ‘law ο1 things’ ior the purposes os his ow
system. 11 he had meant something totally different from them th· r
would have been no consusi0n3 but the very lact that his meanin
was somewhat the same, but at the same time somewhat differen
has surrounded the matter with difficulties, to remove which .·
attempt will be made by pursuing a strictly analytical method, and b*
attending strictly to the language os the Roman lawyers themselves
without giving any fancy meaning to classical expressions whose actua

· signification can be ascertained with tolerable certainty.

 

What did the Romans mean by ‘ persona'i Itis clear there is som
relation between persona and homo; sor the leading division ο1 the ‘i ·
quod ad personas pertinet’ (i. 3. pr.) is that all men are either [ree ο
slaves. It is equally clear that they did not regard all men as persons
it is not said all persons, but all men, are either sree or slaves. Slaves
in lact, except very occasionally by a siip ο1 the pen (eg. Insti 8. pr.
are not regarded by the Romans as persons; an essential clement ἰ
