DE LOCATIONE ET CONDUCTIONE.

Locatio et conductio proxima est emptioni et venditioni
isdemque iuris regulis consistunt. narn ut emptio et venditio
ita contrahitur, si de pretio convenerit, sic etiam locatio et
conductio ita contrahi intellegitur, si merces constituta sit et
competit locatori quidem locati actio, conductori vero con·

lducti. Et quae supra diximus, si alieno arbitrio pretium

permissum luerit, eadem et de locatione et conductione dicta
esse intellegamus, si alieno arbitrio merces permissa fuerit.
qua de causa si lulloni polienda curandave aut sarcinatori
sarcienda vestimenta quis dederit nulla statim mercede consti·
tuta, sed postea tantum daturus, quantum inter eos convenerit,

was held to be conditional on its future existence ς eg. a crop which is
liable to be destroyed by lloods: an ‘emptio spei’ was absolute, Dig.
18. r. 8.

att. xm, In many points, as is observed in the text, the rules ot
locatio conductio are (mutatis mutandis) identical with those oi sale
The contract is concluded as soon as the parties are agreed upon the
thing to be let and the hire money (merces), which must be pecunia
numerata, § 2, except that the rent os agricultural land may be paid in
kind, the amount being fixed either absolutely orat a certain proportior
os the yearly fruits, Cod. 4 6 5. 21. So too the merces, like the pretium,
must be certa and vera, but need not be iusta, understanding these
terms in the senses already given to them under Tit. ²33 nor, finally,
need the letter be dominus os that which he lets (Dig. 19. 2. 7 ; ib. 9pr.
and 6); else subletting would have been impossible.

Transactions ol three different kinds are included under this contract:
(1) Locatio conductio rerum, the letting by one (locator) and hiring by
another (conductor) os a thing moveable or immoveable (eg. a house
with its premiseS, in which case the hirer was called inquilinus: or
agricultural land, when he was called colonus, Bk ii. 1. 36 supr), or
even ol a res incorporalis, e.g. a usufruct, Dig. 7. 1. 12. 2; ib. 38.

(2) Locatio conductio operarum, the letting by one (locator) ot' his
services only to another (conductor), as in all contracts ol free service.

(3) Locatio conductio operis, where one (conductor) engages to execute
a specific piece oi work, e. g. build a house, a ship, a carriage, etc, for
another (locator). Here the ordinary use ol the ternis describing the
parties is inverted, the one who contracts to do the wo'rk, and who we
should say is hired, being regarded as the hirer.
