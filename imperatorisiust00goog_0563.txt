divae memoriae loquitur constitutio: sin autem quantitate vel
alio modo plus suerit petitum, omne, si quid sorte damnum ex

section, was an equitable remedy introduced by the praetor through
the edict, which in the formulary period had been perhaps the most
striking example oi his extraordinaria cognitio. lts functiou had been
the rescission, in this or that concrete case, ol rights and duties resulting
from the operation oi the ordinary law, because under the special cir·
cumstances equity so required, exactly as equity in England gave relies,
ior instance, against mistake, when law afforded no remedy whatever.
And this rescission was effected by the direct and immediate action os
the magistrate 3 it was an exercise oi his imperium, not of his iurisdictio:
in integrum restitutio in its proper sense being thus distinguished from
analogous cases in which a restoration occurred either ipso iure (asin
postliminium) or by the remedial process os the ordinary law.

The conditions under which in integrum restitutio could be applied lor
areas follow:

(1) The applicant must have suffered a prejudice (laesio) from the
operation os law, which may be lucrum cessans no less than damnum
incidens, Dig. 44 7. 6 ; 4. 6. 27, but which need not be strictly proprietary‚
Dig.4 4. 3. 6; ior examples see notes on §§ 4 and 5 supr, Bk ii. 155
supr, Gaius iv. 57. On the principle ‘de minimis non curat lex’it
seems also to have been requisite that the laesio should not be merely
trivial

(2) The mere existence oi a laesio in itseli is insufficient; there must
also be a ground (iusta causa) upon which the application is based.
These are six in number: ‘integri restitutionem praetor tribuit ex his
causis quae per metum, dolum, et status permutationem, et iustum
errorem, et absentiam necessariam, et infirmitatem aetatis gesta esse
dicuntur' Paul sent. rec. 1. 7. 23 ci. Dig. 4. 1.1.

The restitutio of a minor (ie. person under twenty-five years ol age)
was independent, is he were also impubes, ir his guardian’s auctoritas
having been given to the disposition against which he appealed, Cod 5.
71. 11, except where it was payment to him oi a debt, Dig. 4. 4 7. 2 ; and
under exceptional circumstances he could not obtain restitutio at all, e. g.
where he had represented himself as os full age, Cod. 2. 45. 13 where
the person against whom he claimed it was also a minor, Dig.4 4. 11. 6 ;
and where he had contracted a money loan at his father’s order, Dig.
ib. 3. 4.

Upon any ol the remaining five causae a person ol tull age could get
himself restitutus no less than a minor.

In integrum restitutio was not the only t'orm oi relief obtainable
where one had been induced to malre a disposition by intimidation or
fraud. Dolus had always been a sufficient delence in a bonae fidei action,
and it was made pleadable l in the sorrn of an exceptio) to actions stricti
iuris by a praetor called Cassius, Dig. 44. 4. 4. 33. ln lac. 71 a praetor
named Octavius introduced the actio and exceptio quod metus causa,
and finally, five years later, Gallus Aquilius added the actio doli.
