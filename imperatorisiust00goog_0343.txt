The intestato succession to lreedmen is dealt with in Title 7, the
earlier paragraphs ol which give a historical summary os the old
rulcs in cases ol both testacy and intestacy, and ol the changes intro
duccd in the interest ol the patron by the Praetor and the lex Papia

Poppaea Between this, and a briel account ol the curiously con-
trasted mode of succession to Latini Iuniani, a class ol lreedmen
which as we know was abolished by Justinian, is a statement ol his
own settlement ol the classes entitled to succeed upon the intestacy
ola civis libertus, and ol the latter's testamentary rights against the
patron. The modification which might conceivably be effecteu in
these mles by the exercise ol a power, conlerred by a senatusconsult,
ol assigning any particular lreedman to any particular child in oue's
power is considered in Title 8.

The Roman law of intestate successim, especially to ingenui, is an
admirable illustration of the heterogeneous mass ol rules which may
grow round any· subject usually regulated by law where there is a
variety ol legislative organs, often actuated by diverse motives‚ and
little anxiety in the supreme legislature or in the lawyer class to
reduce them to formal order and unity by some process ol oodifi·

· cation Technically‚ os course, the rules which, at the date of the

publication ol the Institutes, decided on whom au intestate persou's
universitas iuris should devolve, were enacted by Justinian himself ς
historically‚ they originated either in the Twelve Tables, or in the
Edict relating to bonorum possessi0, or in the later civil law, which,
either through senatusconsulta or imperial constitutions conterred
at long intervals ol legislation, and in an entirely disconnected
manner, rights ol succession upon relatives ol the deceased whom
the earlier law had altogether passed over. The main drilt os this
series ol changes was the same throughout; to fill up the voids
and correct the anomalies ol the Twelve Tables; to substitute
cognatiori lor agnation as the sole title a person could have to
succeed. No department ol law called more imperatively fora
comprehensive simplification, such, lor instance, as that which we
have seen Justinian effected in the law ol Usucapion and Prescription;
hut the changes made in the Corpus luris are hesitating and tentative,
the most considerable perhaps being that in the classes ol bonorum
possessores, necessitated by Justinian’s reform in the succession to
liberti, ol which a lull account is given in Title 9. When the Insti-
