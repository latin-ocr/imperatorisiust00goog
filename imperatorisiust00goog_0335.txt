hence no one can stand in this relation to a mere right (p. ²09 supr.)
The right to interdieta, however, was grounded upon adisturbance iu
some unlawiul manner oi the exercr'sc oi ownership, and the exercise
ol other n'ghts, as well as that oi ownership, cau be unlawfully dis·
turbed ; so that it seemed only logical that here too unwarranted
interserence should be guarded against by the same remediea Accord-
ingly, the enjoyment oi iura in re aliena was protected by possessory
interdicts3 they were deemed to be quasi-possessed (nuris quasi pos·
sessio’ Dig. 8. 5. 10, ‘possessionem vel corporis vel iuris ’ Dig. 43. 2⁶.
a. 3). The expression, as Savigny remarks, is an improperextension
oi analogical language; quasi possessio indicates the exercise of a ius
in re aliena, being related to the latter in the same way as possession
srrr'crosensu is to dominium. Nor is it possible to ‘detain' an obJ'ect
which, though corporeal, is indeterminate, such as an uncertain por·
tion oi a thing. Finally, the idea of detention being that of exclusive
physical control, we have the rule ‘plures eandem rem in solidum
possidere non possunt3‘ i. e. il we read that a previously existing
possession (and a fortiori detention) still continues, no new possession
(and α fortiori detentioni can possibly have commenced; and cou-
versely, il the law recognises a new possession, the previous possession
must have ceased to exist.

When to this Detention is superadded a further (mental) clement, it
becomes Possession, an interest protected by special legal remedies,
viz. interdicta. That mental element is the intention, on the part oi
the detainer, ol dealing with the thing detained as owner; oi exercis-
ing over it, on his own bahali, the rights which an owner exercises on
his. This intention is usually called the animus domini or sibi
habendi; the phrase does not occur in the authorities, the nearest
approach to it being Theophilus' νέμεσθαί ἐστι τὸ ψυχῇ &nicoma mr·
ἐχειν. It should carelully be marked, that it isan intention3 it has
nothing to do with a heliel that one is owner (opinio or cogitatio
domini), lor the possessing thies or robber is as capable of the animus
domini as the most innocent possessor, and is as sully entitled to the
protection ol interdicts as the latter; ‘adversus extraneos vitiosa
possessio prodesse solet' Dig. 4¹· a. 53. In other words, possession
is independent oi bona fides: ‘it is possession, whether iusta or iniusta;'
the ius possessionis, the right involved in possession, the right pro·
tectcd by interdicts, is quite distinct from and independent of the ius
possidendi, or right to possess, which belongs not to the law of pos-
session, but oi ownership.

Possession‚ then, as a legal right, consists of two elements, deten-
