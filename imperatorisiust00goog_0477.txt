The legal 0110010 01 natural obligation have as yet been defined
only negatively; it did not entitle the creditor to sue. As to iu ’
positive effects, no general rule can be laid down for all cases: they
must be determined 101 each case individually, 101 the creditor’s right,
in one instance, may have a greater or less orbit than in another;
in other words, apart from the right 01 action, anatural obligation

though he cannot directly sue 101 11 himself : ‘etiam quod natura debe·
