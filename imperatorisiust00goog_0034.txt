NEW MAGISTRACIES-LEGES LICINIAE. 21

with that ol the oomitia centuriata, but only that the tribal assembly
was established in the iorm in which it had existed, and with the
iunctione which it had enjoyed, before the regular constitution had
been suspended hythe appointment ol the commission ol codification.
One result ol this restoration was that the patricians now began to
take part in the comitia tributa, which thereby gradually lost its
character as a merely plebeian assembly. Either by the same statute,
or by another carried by the same consuls, it was provided that in
future no new magistrate should be created from whose decisions there
should be no appeal (provocatio) to the centuries.

The mensures by which the coveted ‘exaequatio iuris' was linally
attalned require a briei review. The lex Canuleia (3.0. 445) legiti-
mated connubium between patriciana and plebeians, and by uniting
the members ol the two orders by the tie of blood rapidly paved the
way ior the other enactments which at length welded them into an
united people, with identlcal interests, and equal one with another in
the eye oi the law. Two years later was introduced the office oi censor,
which immediately became os large political importance. The duty
of making out the lists os citizens in their various classes oi course
involved a very considerable power ol affecting the individual in his
political rights; thus, sor instance, the censors were privileged to
exclude a man from the senate, to deprive an eques ol his horse and
rank, or to remove a plebeian from his tribe, on account ol delects
not only ol legal qualification but even oi moral character ; while as
moribus praelecti they could lower bis· position in the eye ol his
selon-citizens hythe subscriptio censoria, or mark set against his
name in their official list—the sure indication oi dishonesty or pro·
iligacy. Among the other functions through which they gained their
political influence may be enumerated the administration of the public
revenues, the larming ol the customs, and the making ol all contracte
l'or public works

At the time ol the passing ol the lex Canuleia, the plebeians had
striven hard to gain access to the consulship, but their ellorts had
been baffled by the patriciana who, however, conceded that a new
magistracy should be established, ‘tribuni militum consulari potestate:
to relieve the consuls oi some ol their duties, and to this new office

members ol the plebs were to be eligible. At first it seems to have
been frequently held by plebeians, but by degrees the patricians
succeeded in making it almost as exclusively their own as the consul·
ship had ever been, and Livy represents (vi. 3¹1) atribune ol the plebs
aa saying in the year ac. 3⁶9 that no plebeian bad attained this
