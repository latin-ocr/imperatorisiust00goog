Titi] DE ACTIONIBUS. 553

iacere potest propter retentionem quoque dotis repetitio
minuitur: nam ob impensas in res dotales iactas marito re·
tentio concessa est, quia ipso iure necessariis sumptibus dos
minuitur, sicut ex latioribus digestorum libris cognoscere liceat
Sed et si quiscum parente suo patronove agat, item si socius 38
cum socio iudicio societatis agat, non plus actor consequitur,
quam adversarius eius lacere potest. idem est, si quis ex
donatione sua conveniatur. Compensationes quoque oppositae 39

defendant was said to have a beneficium competentiae, which was
pleaded in desence as an exceptio, the creditor being bound to spare him
enough ol his property to live on, except in actions based on delict and
fraud: ‘in condemnatione personarum, quaein id quod facere possunt
damnantur, non toturn quod habent extorquendum est, sed et ipsorum
ratio habenda est, ne egeant' Dig. 50. 17. 1735 cs. Dig. 42. r. 19. r.
This privilege was accorded by the law on three grounds. On account
ol the peculiar persona} relation between the parties it belonged to
husband and wife against one another, to parents against children,
patrons against freedmen (ξ 38 ini), and to the father-inlaw if sued by the
husband for a promised dos durante matrimonio. By reason oi the
nature ol' the obligation upon which the action was based it was possessed
by the husband and bis representatiwes when sued for the recovery oi a
dos, by socii inter se, and by the promisor ola gift (ξ 38 ini). On account
oi the personal position of the debtor it belonged to the insolvent who
had made a cessio bonorum (ξ 40 int), to soldiers against all creditors
whatsoever, and to children who had been recently released from patria
potestas in respectos debts contracted while alieni iuris, unless by the
iatber's death they had come into substantial property. Finally, the
beneficium might be acquired by contract, Dig. 2. 14· 49.

When sued lor the recovery ol the dos at the termination oi the
marriage by the wile, her heirs, or the paternal ascendant who bad given
it, or during the marriage on account oi mismanagement or insolvency,
tbe husband or his heirs or representatives could deduct impensae
necessariae, by the sum ol which the velue ol the dos was held to have
tacitly (ipso iure) diminisbed. For impensae utiles as distinct from
necessariae the husband could advmce a claim only by actio mandati or
negotiorum gestorum, Cod ς η 5. The old retentiones propter liberos,
propter mores, etc, described by Ulpian, reg. b 9-17, were obsolete in
the nme ol Justinian.

i ³8. li the societas was omnium bonorum, the partner against whom
the actio pro socio was brought could plead beneficium competentiae as a
matter os right ; ilunius rei, the praetor would grant it only after investi·
gation: ‘quod autem de sociis dictum est, ut et hi in quantum facere
possint condemnentur, causa cognita se iacturum praetor edicit’ Dig. 42.
