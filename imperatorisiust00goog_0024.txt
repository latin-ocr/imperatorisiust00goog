THE TRIBUNATE-PlEBEIAN GRIEVANCES. 11·

is now spoken of as twenty-one, whereas the authorities, in describ·
ing the inauguration of the Servian tribal organization‚ bring the
four tribus urbanae alone into prominent notice; and Livy, in his
account of it, does not so much as mention the tribus rusticae at all.
Of far greater constitutional importance, however, was the establish-
ment of five special elective plebeian magistrates, tribuni plebis, whose
office none could bold unless he were himself plebeian; those who
violated their personal liberty or security were to be outside the pro·
tection of the law. Not being magistratus populi, but merely leaders
of the plebs, they could not, like the consuls, take the political ini-
tiative; their strength lay in resistance, or, more especially, in the
right of veto with which they were invested, and which enabled them
to stop and render ineffectual any magisterial action by which they
deemed the interests of the plebs were threatened; unless they were
unanimous, one tribune could veto another. This institution of the
tribunate afforded a surer means whereby the resolutioris of the plebs
could acquire the force of law. The tribunes were not members
of the senate in virtue of their office, but they were permitted to
appear at the threshold of tbe building where that body held its
deliberations, and lay before it the proposals of the order which they
represented; if approved, these proposals could then be referred in
the ordinary way to the comitia centuriata, and thereby become
genuine enactments of the sovereign populus¹. The election of the
tribunes was by a len Publilia (nc. 471) vested in the· comitia tributa,
and their number was by the same statute raised from five to ten. At
the same time patricians seem to bave been made eligible for the
office3 in the year ac. 448 only eight of the ten were plebeians.
hfeasures vvere also taken to relieve insolvent debtors from their
obligations, and promises were made of reforms in this brancb of
law.

One or two other subjects of plebeian complaint may be here
mentioned, along with the half measures by which it was attempted
to remedy them, in order to show that the enactment of the Twelve
Tables was preceded by a period of discontent and even active
agitation, and that the relations of the two parties were still in a sort
of ferment, and incapable of satisfactory adjustment except by some
constitutional reform of more than ordinary comprehensiveness
Numbers of tbe leading plebeians were injured by the exclusion of
connubium between themselves and the patrician order. Though
