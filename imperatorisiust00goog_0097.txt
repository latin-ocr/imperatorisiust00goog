84 INTRODUCTION TO BOOK l.

the real signification of this division of law into personae, res, and
actiones, 13 the supposition that it was 3 classification of great an-
tiquity among the Romans themselves, a classifieation which they
regarded 33 fundamental and not lightly to be departed from, and
by understanding which therefore we shall obtain a deeper insight
into their· national legal habit, and comprehend more fully the lead·
ing distinctions of their system, and the interconnection of its parts
Such 3 supposition, however, is an error which it is important once
for all to discard. Sir Henry Maine has pointed out¹ that there is
no reason to suppose that the Roman lawyers set any extraordinary
value 011 this classilication· It was eonfined, he says, to their institu-
tional treatises, or primers of law, the educational mannals placed in
the hands of their beginners. We may add that Gaius’ other well·
known work, the ‘res quotidianae,’ was composed on another plan,
and that the order followed in the Institntes of Florentinus, who wrote
after Gaius, was also quite different. The Twelve Tables again, and
the Praetorian Edict as consolidated by Salvius Julianus, have no
trace of the Gaian classilication ; the Gregorian and Hermogenian
codes were arranged upon a different principle; so was the code of
Theodosius 11 ς 30 are the two larger works of Justinian himself. It
may even be the ease, as Savigny 1133 suggested, that that elassifica-
tion was based on an individual, accidental opinion of Gaius himself3
upon any view, however, we cannot suppose that by the ordinary
Roman jurist the division was regarded as much more important than
other current contrasts which Savigny instances‚ such as those of vi,
clam, and precario, the three forms 01 domestic dependenee, potestas·
manus, and mancipium, the three capitis deminutiones, and the three
classes of cives, Latini, and peregrini. If there was any traditional
view among the Romans as to the true mode of classifying their legal
rules, Sir H. hlaine has shown, in the paper referred to, that it was
probably the view which from the force of circumstances has prevailed
111 nearly every indigenous system of law under primitive conditions,
and which assigns the first place in the code to judicature and rules
01 procedure, in the interstices of which the substantive law 1133 111
early times the appearance 01 being gradually secreted. The material
= law tends to become distributed into ‘heads of dispute’ in 331 order
which seems to depend on their relative importance when it was
finally determined, and in which, in more celebrated codes than one,
a prominent place is given, in particular, to deposita and thefts.
