628 EXCURSUS X.

never all found together, usually followed in much the same relative
order. We will first examine those inserted in the interest of the
plaintiff.

The Demonstratio, when found in a formula, immediately follows
the appointment of the iudex, and contains the allegationof fact upon
which tbe plaintiff bases his claim. It invariably begins with ‘quod'
‘whereas ς’ eg. in Gaius iv. 39 ‘quod Aulus Agerius Numerio Ne·
gidio hominem vendidit ;' or · apud Numerium Negidium hominem
deposuit! Occasionally the place of the demonstratio is taken bya
praescriptio (pro actore), and sometimes even the latter is prefixed to
or worked into the former 3 its use is contined to formulae upon
actions in which the plaintiff is entitled from the defendant to a number
or variety of acts prima facie hanging together, but of which oue only, ⁸
or at least not all, are claimed in the present aetion. By the prae·
scriptio, beginning ‘ea res agatur, let the present trial relate exclusively
to so and s0,' the plaintiff reserved his right of action upon the other
acts, or those subsequently to fall due, which would otherwise have
been consumed; it being a presumption of Roman law (capable,
however, of being rebutted by the insertion ofa praescriptio in the
formula) that when a man instituted an action, it comprised all his
claims against the defendant, prospective no less than present, so far
at least as they related to the present ground of action, and already
had at least a potential existence. Two examples are given by Gaius
In the one, a man to whom au annuity is payable, say, every six
months, sues for a half year’s instalment, using the praescriptio ‘ea
res agatur cuius rei dies fuit 3' in the other, the purchaser of an estate,
claiming that it shall be conveyed to him by mancipation, reserves to
himself the right of subsequently demanding its mere traditio by a
praescriptio in the form ‘ea res agatur de fundo mancipando!

- The Intentio, which follows the Demonstratio if there be one,is the
part of the formula ‘qua ector desiderium suurn concludit: in which
the plaintiff either affirms the legal right which he claims against the
defendant, or else states a fact or facts (in which latter case' there is never
a demonstratio) from which the right is to be inferred. Itis easily to

reader against confusing the Roman iudex wilh an English judge. The former was
merely a private citizen, appointed by the praetor after amicable selection by the
parties, to determine certain issues of law and fact in acoordanoe with the evidence
laid before him. Towards the end of the republican period the office, which bad
previously been thought an honour, came to be regarded as a burdent and this led
to the institution by Augustus of an 'album iudicum selectorum,' from whom the
judge had to be chosen, and who were compellable to hear cases seut to them by
.tbe praetor. , ,
