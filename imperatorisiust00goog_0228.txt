DE USUCAPIONTBUS ET LONGI TEMPORIS
POSSESSIONIBUS.

Iure civili constitutum fuerat, ut, qui bonafide ab eo, qui
dominus non erat, cum crediderit eum dominum esse, rem
emerit vel ex donatione aliave qua iusta causa acceperit, is
eam rem, si mobilis erat, anno ubique, si immobilis biennio

portant branch of the latter, viz. servitudes. He now returns to the civil
modes of acquisition, which are two in number, usucapio (Tit. 6), and
donatio (Tit. 7).

lt has been already observed that in the Roman system civil are older
than natural titles. Three of the former were obsolete before Justinian’s
time, or were abolished by him, viz,

(1) Addictio in the wider sense, the making over of property to indi-
viduals in the name of the people hythe decree ofa magistrate, especially
in the form of emptio sub corona (Gell. 7. 4), and sectio bonorum. (2)
In iure cessio, a voluntary transfer effected under magisterial authority
through the fiction of a suit at law, as in the English fines and recoveries.
lt is described by Gaius ii. 24, who tells us (25) that even in his day it
had been abandoned for the conveyance of corporeal single things,
though still used in manumissions (note on Bk. i. 5. 1 supr), emanci-
pations, adoptions (note on Bk. i. 11. 2 supr.)‚ transfer of tutela legitima
libertae (Ulpian, reg. 19. 11), creation of servitudes, and conveyance of
the right to accept an inheritance (Gaius ii. 3 5-37). ln justinian’s time
it had altogether disappeared. (3) Mancipatio: res mancipi (viz. land
and rustic servitudes in Italy, slaves, domestic beasts of burden, free
persons in potestas, manus or mancipium, and under certain circum·
stances a man’s whole property in the aggregate (familia)) could be con·
veyed in full ownership only by this or in iure cessio 3 it is described by
Gaius i. 119-122. Mancipation disappeared from the law of Justinian
owing to his abolition of the distinction between res mancipi and uec
mancipi, eod. 7. 31.

Two other civil modes of acquisition still operative under Justinian
are not here treated by him, viz.

(4) Lex, which includes legacy (Tit an pr. int) and caduca and erep-
titia; Ulpian, reg. 19 17.

(5) Adiudicatio, the sentence of a judge in a iudicium divisorium,
whereby property vests iu the individual in severalty without the neces·
sity of ordinary conveyance, Blc iv. 17. 8 inf.

The next Title‚ on the subject of usucapio, presupposes some know-
ledge of the Roman law of Possession. For this see Excursus 111 at the
end of this Book.
