parebit. Erat et ex senatus consulto Claudiano miserabilisl
per universitatem adquisitio, cum libera mulier servili amore
bacchata ipsam libertatem per senatus consultum amittebat
et cum libertate substantiam: quod indignum nostris tem-
poribus esse existimantes et a nostra civitate deleri et non
inseri nostris digestis concessimus.

DE OBLIGATIONIBUS.

Nunc transeamus ad obligationes. obligatio est iuris vin·
culum, quo necessitate adstringimur alicuius solvendae rei
secundum nostrae civitatis iura. Omnium autem obligationum t

the actions which they brought for the establishment of their claims, and
by whom the assets were sold in lots; the proceeds of the sale were
distributed by the judge among the creditors, in a determinate order of
priority (for which see Poste's Gaius p. 3 52). Properry which the insol-
vent might subsequently acquire remained liable to successive sales, until
the creditors had been paid in full.

Embarrassed debtors could also usually avail themselves of a pro·
cedure more in the nature of a voluntary composition with creditors,
called cessio bonorum (Blc iii. 25. 8; iv. 6. 40; ib. ¹4 4 inf), which was
introduced by a lex Iulia of one of the two first Caesars. By adopting
this course they escaped liability ro arrest and imprisonment, Cod. 7. 71.
r, which bankrupts proper might still incur if the missio in bona produced
uo results; a debtor could be committed to prison ar the outset only on
the applicarion of the Treasury. Further, they did not become infames,
like banlerupts, Cod. 2. 12. 2, and were allowed to retain so much of their
after-acquired property as was necessary for their subsistence (beneficium
competentiae, see on Bk. iv. 6. 37 inf), Dig. 42. 3. 4, cod 7. 7¹· r. No
debtor‚ however, could claim ro make a cessio bonorum whose insol·
vency was due to his own fault, Cod. 7. 71. 8. pr. The procedure after
the surrender seems in all essentia] points to have been the same as in
bankruptcy.

Α mode of universal succession described by Gaius (iii. 85-87), but not
alluded to by Justinian, as being obsolete in his day, is in iure cessio of
an heredit as by an agnate entitled on inresracy‚ tor which see p. 2 56 supr.
It seems improper to regard this as a universal succession, for what the
agnete transferred was, not the hereditas, but the single right of becoming
heres to a succession as yet only delata
