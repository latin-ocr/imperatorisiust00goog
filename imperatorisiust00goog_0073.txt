60 INTRODUCTION.

rized jurists at the time ol their appointment bad been the five whose
names have been mentioned. And the soree ol this lact is irresistibly
increased by the words used by Justinian in Cod. r. ιγ. a. ao with
reference to the publication ol the Digest, where he says that he has
therein made selections from the jurists (legislatores et commentatores)
‘quos et anteriores piissimi principes admittere non sunt indignati!

It would seem then that the true meaning ol the disputed passage
is that which has been given to it by other civilians¹; namely, that
it was intended to supplya criterion by which the authority ol any
and every juristic writer could be tested. Its intention was not to
exclude any authorized jurist, but to remove the difficulty which arose
srorn the existence and quotation ol works by writers who had re·
ceived no auctoritas or ius respondendi, and to which Justinian bears
witness in Cod. 1. 17. r. 4. The test was to be the ius respondendi,
and the possession of this was to be inferred from the lact ol one
jun'st being cited as an authority by another os undeniable reputation.
The legislator attained his object by selecting a small number of the
most recent and distinguished jurists who had possessed the ius re·
spondendi, and hy confirming their authority, and also that of all
others whose views they quoted. Some difficulty is occasioned by
the words ‘si tamen eorum libri propter antiquitatis incertum codicum
collatione,' which seem to mean that even when a jurist is cited by
one ol the five, he is not to be allowed avoice in the decision ol a
case unless his view, as quoted, is proved and confirmed bya com·
parison oi the passage oi the citing jurist with the original work
(codices) ol the author quoted. The enactment would thus prac-
tically secure to all approved writers the weight which they had
hitherto enjoyed, while it would relieve judges ol the weary taslr of
listening to the opinions oi others oi only second-rate importance;
it excluded only jurists who bad never possessed a first-rate reputa·
tion, and in particular those who lived alter Modestinus⁹.

¹ The opening words in the passage transcribed abore irom the ‘law oi Cita-
tions,' by which the statutory authority which the other iour leading jurists had
always possessed is extended to Gaius, go to show that the latter was not a
‘iuris auctor,' and had never been invested with the ‘ius respondendi' ‘lhis in·
serenae is supported by the lact that though his writings were so various. they
contained no responsa, though among them was a ‘liber de casibus· in which he
collected a large number of illustrative cases, many oi which were imaginary,
while of the real ones none had been authoritatively pronounced upon by himself.
