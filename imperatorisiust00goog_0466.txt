condicio adiciatur, novationem fieri, sic intellegi oportet, ut
ita dicamus iactam novationem, si condicio extiterit: alioquin
si deiecerit, durat prior obligatio. Sed cum hoc quidem

inter veteres constabat tunc fieri novationem, cum novandi
animo in secundam obligationem itum luerat: per hoc autem
dubium erat, quando novandi animo videretur hoc heri et
quasdam de hoc praesumptiones alii in aliis casibus intro·
ducebant: ideo nostra processit constitutio, quae apertissime
definivit tunc solum fieri novationem, quotiens hoc ipsum
inter contrahentes expressum luerit, quod propter novationem
prioris obligationis convenerunt, alioquin manere et pristinam
obligationem et secundam ei accedere, ut maneat ex utraque
causa obligatio secundum nostrae constitutionis definitiones,

naturalem transfusio atque translatio, hoc est, cum ex praecedenti causa
ita nova constituatur, at prior perimatur' Dig. 46. 2. 1. pr. ; novation is
the extinction of one obligation by the substitution for it ol another.
Originally it could take place in two ways, transcriptio (Excursus Vlll
inf.) and stipulatio ; but in Justinian’s time the latter was the only means
available for the purpose. The end in view in a novation may be either
to change one ol the parties to the subsisting obligation, or, without
changing the parties, to alter its nature either by converting a real or
consensual into a verbal obligation or by modifying its terrns. The first

of these ends is illustrated in the text hythe words veluti si id. . . in ·

posteriorem the second, by the paragraph commencing sed si eadern
persona.. . .

‘Ibe parties may be changed in two ways. Firstly, the creditor
may be changed, the amoum and terms ol the debt remaining the same
Tms, if A owes B 5l., and C (with B’s consent) stipulates from A for
payment os that debt to himself, A's debt to B is extinguished. The
same etl‘ect might be produced, though perhaps with a difference of
remedy, without novation, by B's assigning his rights against A to C,
Gaius ii. 38, 39, Excursus V inl. Secondly, the debtor might be changed,
the creditor remaining the same. Thus, ii under the circumstances
supposed, B stipulated from C sor payment to himself ol the 5l. which A
owed him, A's debt to B would be cancelled. 1r this was done with A's
assent, it is usually called delegatio; ii not, ex promissio ; but see Poste’s
Gaius, p. 670.

lt is immaterial whether the obligation which is novated be civilis or
merely naturalis: its extinction involves that ol all rights which were
accessory to it, such as guaranties, hypothccs, claims lor interest and
penalties, etc, Dig. 46. 2. 155 ib. 18; ib. 27 ; ib. 29. So too, as is said
in the text, the obligation created by the novating contract will ex·
tinguish the old oue even though it be natural only, i. e. lor some reason
