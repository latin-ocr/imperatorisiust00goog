334 INTRODUCT 1οΝ Τ 0 BOOK ΙΙΙ.

Roman Law3 altematives are soon tolerated lor the old sacramenta]
terms, which none could use but Roman citizens, and thus peregrini
are enabled to avail themselves ol this universally applicable contract
lorm; the question and answer are allowed to be expressed in other
languages than Latin, and the strict and literal correspondence between
them is no longer regarded as indispensable; finally, that they should
be oral, and so require the presence oi the parties, is found to be an
inconvenient and unnecessary condition, and the original solemnities
ol stipulation have dwindled into a written memorandum ol a promise
fictitiously represented as having been made in answer to a preceding
question. Some minor matters, such as the qualification oi such
promises by time and conditione, and the use oi penalties under
many circumstances, are touched upon in the same Title. Joint'and
several liability, or as the modern civilians term it, Correslity or
Solidarity, is brielly noticed in Title 16, because whenever it arose ex
contractu it usually took the form ol stipulation. In Title 17 we have
a statement ol the effect oi promises made by stipulation to a slave:
a subject treated in relatffon to obligations generally, and to persons in
patria as well as dominica potestas, in Title 28. Title 18 relates to a
classification ol stipulations according as they are based upon genuine
consent, or are forced upon a party by a judge or magistrate, and so
reminds the reader ol the traditional division ol contracta in English
law into ‘contracts ol record' and contracta in the ordinary sense ol
the term. This is followed in Title 19 by an ill-arranged exposition
oi circumstances which allect the validity of contracta in general, and
ol stipulations in particular, such as illegality, impossibility, inlancy,
and weakness ol intellect; and here too we have a precise statement
ol the jural maxim that an obligation is a tie between ascertained
parties, incapable ol conferring rights or imposing liabilities on others
who are not parties to it themselves, and Justinian's own repeal ol
some previously existing rules invalidating stipulations, but out ol
harmony with the modern principle that ‘consent is the essehce ol
contract' Title 20 relates to fideiussi0‚ a lorm ol suretyship effected
by stipulation ; other modes in which this important relation could be
established are described in the notes to this Title and Title 26. Title
ar, professedly on literal contract, tells us little more than that literal
contract in the true sense (expensilatio) had long been obsolete, though
it also touches a subject upon which more is said in Excursus Vlll inl.
