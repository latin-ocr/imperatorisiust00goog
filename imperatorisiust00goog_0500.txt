INTRODUCTION TO BOOK lV.

Tira first five Titles oi this Book relate to the two classes oiObliga·
tions which have not yet been treated, namely, those which arise from
Delict and Quasi-delict. These, we are told, are all osone character:
that is to say, the existence oi the obligation does not depend in difie-
rent cases on different ‘causae,’ in the sense in which, for instance,
Sale is binding so soon as the parties have agreed upon the price,
while Euchange produces no vinculum iuris until there has been per-
sonnance on one side; but their ‘causa' is always the same, viaa
wrongsul act (res), upon the commission os which the obligation at
once starts into existence. Οἱ such wrongiul acts four have specific
names, and are called Delicta : Thest (lurtum), Robbery (rapina), an'ury
to property (damnum), and wilsul injury to the person or reputation
(iniuria).

The precise differentia of Delict, as compared with other forms oi
legal wrong, and the reason why some oi these offences-notably Thest
and Robbery-were ever treated by the Romans as civil wrongs at all,
are topics upon which something is said in the commentary below.
The text oi the first Title deals with Thes . The definition ol this, as
the deliberately wrongiul dealing with (moveable) property, is con·
trasted with our own English treatment oi the ofience by its width and
generality. Itis Theo not merely to appropriate what one lrnows to
belong to another, but to barely use a thing of which one has under·
taken the custody or which one holds in pledge, to turn what hasbeen
lent one to a use which it is not believed the lender would have sanc-
tioned, or even to deptive another os the possession oi an obiect which
one has delivered to him as security ior money owed.

The Romans divide the offence into two orders, according as the
delinquent is or is not detected in its commission; the penalty in the
first case being a mulct os four times, in the second one os twice the
value os the property stolen: besides this, the offender or bis heirs can
be compelled by an independent action to restore the property itseli
or its value. Certain obsolete varieties oi Thest, punisbed under the
older law by penalties quantitativeiy differing from these, are incident·
aily noticed; the liubility oi instigators and accessories is accurately
