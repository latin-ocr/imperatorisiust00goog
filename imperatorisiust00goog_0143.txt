vinculo copulatum et legitimo adoptionis modo constrictum,
ut et in familia et in potestate huiusmodi patris adoptivi sit.
3Cum autern impubes per principale rescriptum adrogatur,
causa cognita adrogatio permittitur et exquiritur causa adro·
gationis, an honesta sit expediatque pupillo, et cum quibusdam
condicionibus adrogatio fit, id est ut caveat adrogator personae
publicae, hoc est tabulario, si intra pubertatem pupillus de·
cesserit, restituturum se bona illis, qui, si adoptio facta non
esset, ad successionem eius venturi essent. item non alias
emancipare eos potest adrogator, nisi causa cognita digni
emancipatione fuerint et tunc sua bona eis reddat. sed et si
decedens pater eum exheredaverit vel vivus sine iusta causa
eum emancipaverit, iubetur quartam partem ei suorum bo-
norum relinquere, videlicet praeter bona, quae ad patrem
adoptivum transtulit et quorum commodum ei adquisivit

his power in adoption to some one else, was originally effected hya com-
plicated process consisting of three stages. The child vas mancipated
by the paterfamilias to the adopting party (in the case of a son this had

adoptive parent Another mode, practised only in the case of a son,
was for the third mancipation to be made to some person different ”
from both the other patres (pater fiduciarius), by whom he was ceded in
iure to the pater adoptans. Adoption being thus a judicial act was said
to take place ‘imperio magistratus.' ln the earlier periods the consent
of the child was unnecessary, but later this vas altered, Dig. 1. 7. 5. For
this complicated system Justinian substituted a simple declaration of the
parties before a judge, which was registered in the acta, requiring, how·
ever, also the presence of three other persons who by relationship or
mmmmmmmmmmmfflfflssmstmffle
changes referred to in this section, the effect of adoption had been the
translation of the adopted child from the potestas and family of the one
parent to those of the other: to his old father he became a stranger,
but acquired compensating rights of succession, etc, in his new family.
Justinian enacted that in future these consequences should ensue only
where the adoptive father was a natural ascendant of the child (adoptio
plena); if the adoptive father was an extraneus (adoptio minus plena),
the child remafned in his old family, and subject to the same potestas as
before, but acquired a right of succeeding his adoptive father ab intestato,
Cod. 8. 48. ιο.
