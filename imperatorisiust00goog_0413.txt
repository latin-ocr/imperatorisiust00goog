stipulatori adquiratur, solvi tamen Seio etiam invito eo recte
possit, ut liberatio ipso iure contingat, sed ille adversus Seium
habeat mandati actionem. quodsi quis sibi et alii, cuius iuri
subiectus non sit, decern dari aureos stipulatus est, valebit
quidem stipulatio: sed utrum totum debetur quod in stipu-
latione deductum est, an vero pars dimidia, dubitatum est:
sed placet non plusquam partem dimidiam ei adquiri. ei
qui tuo iuri subiectus est si stipulatus sis, tibi adquiris, quia
vox tua tamquam filiisit, sicuti filii vox tamquam tua in·

C’s filiusfamilias or slave) confers no rights on either Β or C ; not on B,
because he has no interest, the promise not being todo something sor
him, ‘inventae sunt enim huiusmodi obligationes ad hoc ut unusquisque
sibi adquirat quod sua interest,' ξ 19 ini. ; and not on C, because he is no
party to the contract. But
(1) Β will acquire a right under the promise (a) it hythe performance
to C he himself obtains a benefit, ξ 20 ins, and this is the reason why the
pater or dominus is entitled under a promise made to him of perionnance
to his filiusfamilias or slave ; the limits to the right are marked hy the
passage cited from Dig. 45. 1. 131. on Tit. 17. 2 supr. : ct Cod. 8. 39. 33
(b) is he has stipulated sor a poena in desault of performance, ξ 19 int'.
(2) C will acquire a right under the promise not only, as is said here,
it he is the promisee’s dominus or pater, but also in a number oi other
cases, of which the following are the most important ε (a) ir the promisee
is merely his messenger or intermediary (but not agent), and the contract
isreal orconsensual (ie. not stipulation), Dig. 2. 14. 2. pn: 13. 5. 14. 3 3
(b) is the transaction is a mutuum given, or an indebitum paid, hy B in
C’s name C can bring the condictio in person, Dig. 12. 1. 2. 4; ib. 9. 83
12. 6. 6. 47 ; (c) a pupil could sue by actio utilis on a constitutum made
by his guardian in his name, Dig. 27. 7. o pr, and plead the exceptio doli
is sued by his creditor with whom the guardian had made a pactum de
non petendo on his behali, Dig. 2. 14. 15 ; ib. 28, 1; (d) where personn-
ance was promised to a man and his heir: ‘suae personae adiungere
quis heredis personam potest’ Dig. 45, 1. 38. 14, though this is in reality
no exception to the general rule. But is A promised B to do so and so for
his (B's) heir (and not ior himself) the promise was void, Gaius iii. 1583
this was altered by justinian, Cod 8. 38. 11 ; cs.§ 13 int (e) ls a gin
were made by B to A on condition of its transfer to C, eona 55. 3.
(s) ls in settling a dos on a woman its restoration to her or‘her
descendants was stipulated for, Dig. 24 3. 45, Cod. 5. 14. 7. (g) li
property was deposited with or lent to A by B on condition ot its being
given up to C, Cod. 3. 42. 8.
Sometimes, however, a person acquired rights under a contract in
ι which he was not directly a party, and was not even so much as named:
in particular (a) where the promisee was a slave or filiusfamilias: see on
