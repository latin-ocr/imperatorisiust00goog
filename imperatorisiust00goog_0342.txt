lNTRODUCTlON TO BOOK 111.

In this book the treatment of universal succession is continued, the
first subJ'ect considered being the mode in which a person's univer·

sitas iuris devolvet on his dying intestate. This falls naturally into
two divisions, according as the deceased was free-bom or libertus.

ot the devolution of a free-bom man's universitas we have a full
, historical account. The first two Titles in the main describe the
classes of persons who succeeded an intestate under the law of the
Twelve Tables: in the first rank being the sui heredes to the ex·
clusion of all other descendants ; in the second the nearest agnate or
agnates, in preference to ascendants and all other collateral relatives
whatsoever. No portion 01 the Institutas presents so clearly the
contrast between modern and ancient law, or brings out more vividly
the exclusive regard paid to agnatio relationship in primitive society.
While pointing out the injustice which this system of succession
entailed upon many classes, especially emancipated children and de-
scendants or collaterale who traced their kinship with the deceased
through a female, Justinian takes occasion to describe briefly the
extent to which a remedy had been supplied by the bonorum possessio
intestati of the Praetor, a subject more explicitly treated in Title 9,
and also various disconnected changes made in the law by earlier
Emperors as well as by himself. To the most sweeping 01 the
Praetor's innovatione, namely that by which he granted rights of
snccession upon intestacy to persons related to the deceased by
cognation alone, though only in subordination to the classes recogniscd
by the Twelve Tables, the fifth Title is exclusively devoted; that
which follows details the mode in which the degrees 01 this natural
relationship are calculated The third and fourth Titles deal with
two enactments 01 the civil law passed in the latter half of the second
century, the SC1. Tertullianum and Orfitianum, which redresseda
wrong arising from the Twelve Tables for which no adequare remedy
bad been provided by the praetorian bonorum possessio. The first 01
these preferred the mother to many of the agnates of her deceased
children: tlte second raised a woman's children from the rank of
