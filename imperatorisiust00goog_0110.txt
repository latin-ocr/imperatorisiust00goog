lt appears then more probable that decreta and rescripta possessed
the force of general law in reference to later cases resembling those for
whose decision they were originally issued‚ provided that the intention
of their respective issuers had been that they should enounce a legal
mle, and not merely determine a specific case. Despite the evidence of
St. Augustine (‘ ut etiam idiotae intelligant, quid specialiter, quid gener·
aliter in quocunque praecepto imperiali sit constitutum ' de doctr. Christ
iii 34), the question whether a particular rescript was intended by its
author to be merely personale (e g. Bk. ii. 19 6 inf), or to state a prin-
ciple of law, became a frequent subject of juristic disputation. Such as
were undoubtedly of the latter character were called generalia rescripta
(e g. Dig. 35. 2. 89 1 ‘divi Severus et Antoninus generaliter rescrip-
serunt Bononio Maximo,’ Dig. 11. 4 1.2 ‘est etiam generalis epistola
divorum Marci et Commodi '). But rescripts were also called ‘generalia'
when it was held that the rule which they contained might be extended
to cases even remotely resembling theone originally decided; e. g. the
rule ignorantia iuris uon excusat is derived in its general form by Papinian
from arescript of Severus and Antoninus, Dig. 22. 6. 9. 5.

From tbe time of Constantine onvard, and in the Eastem Empire, a
particular kind of rescripts acquired the name of ‘pragmatic sanctions.’
These are rescripta in answer to petitions, drawn up in a peculiar and
solemn form, and distinguished from other rescripts by being more
bigbly taxed: Zeno restricted their use to petitions preferred by eorpo-
rations

ln framing constitutions (to whichever of these species they belonged)
tbe emperor was assisted by a council‚ called in the later period con·
sistorium (Cod. 1. 14 8), to which the praefecti urbi and praetorio and
tbe most celebrated jurists belonged, and which gradually assumed the
characteres a general council of state ; it was regularly consulted by the
emperor in the exercise of his supreme appellate jurisdiction, and the
chamber in which such consultations were held was as early as M. Aurelius
called auditorium principis. lt was mainly in this way that the jurists
acquired their knowledge of the imperial constitutions, of which some of
them (e. g. Papirius Justus and Paulus) even made systematic collections.
