Tito] PER QUAS PERSONAS NOBIS ADQUIRITUR. 231

fruetur pro tertia dimidia potiturus. Item vobis adquiritur,a
quod servi vestri ex traditione nanciscuntur sive quid stipu-
lentur vel ex qualibet alia causa adquirunt. hoc enim vobis
et ignorantibus et invitis obvenit. ipse enim servus qui in·
potestate alterius est nihil suum habere potest. sed si heres
institutus sit, non alias nisi iussu vestro hereditatem adire
potest: et si iubentibus vobis adierit, vobis hereditas adquiri·

autem proprietas per eos quos in potestate habetis adquiritur
vobis, sed etiam possessio: cuiuscumque enim rei possessionem
adepti luerint, id vos possidere videmini. unde etiam per eos
usucapio vel longi temporis possessio vobis accedit. De hisr
autem servis, in quibus tanturn usum fruct-um habetis, ita
placuit, ut, quidquid ex re vestra vel ex operibus suis adquir-
ant, id vobis adiciatur, quod vero extra eas causas persecuti

child's own issue to the pater, who by Leo and Anthemius was postponed
also to brothers and sistens. justinian, as he says in§ 1, included under
peculium adventitium (which in the text is called ‘res quae adquisitionem
effugiunt') all that the child acquired otherwise than ex re patris or in the ¹
way of peculium castrense or quasicastrense: under his legislation con·
sequently achild might have rights over property ol three kinds, overone
ol which he bad the absolute control ς one over which his pater had a
usufruct, while he was its dominus; and lastly peculium profectitium,
property oi the pater which the latter could resume at will, and ol which
he himself had only the use and enjoyment ll be were emancipated,
the father originally was entitled absolutely to half the peculium ad·
wentitium, ‘quasi pro pretio emancipationis :' the change which Justinian
made in this matter is mentioned in t 2.
