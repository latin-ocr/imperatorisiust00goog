236 INSYIYUTIONUM LIBRI QUATTUOR. [trull.

sed illa quidem priora duo genera testamentorum ex veteribus
temporibus in desuetudinem abierunt: quod vero per aes et
libram fiebat, licet diutius permansit, attamen partim et hoc
in usu esse desiit. Sed praedicta quidem nomina testamen·
2t0rum ad ius civile reserebantur. postea vero ex edicto prae·
toris alia forma faciendorum testamentorum introducta est:
iure enim honorario nulla emancipatio desiderabatur, sed
septem testium signa sufficiebant, cum iure civili signa testium

of the whole populus, either peaceably assemhled in the comitia at Rome,
or engaged in a campaign in the field : sor the evidence hereby afforded
that intestate was older than testamentary succession see Maine,
Ancient Law pp. 199, aon Both os them were entirely oral. The will
made per aes et libram was perhaps due in origin to the plebeians, who
had no locus standi in the comitia calata, though it must have been
largely used hythe patricians, owing to the length of the intervals at
which wills could be made in the comitia, ‘quae bis in anno testamentis
iaciendis destinata erant’Gaius ii. 101. When writing came into general
use, so that the proceedings need no longer he entirely oral, it underwent
important changes, which are noticed by Gaius, ii. 103-108, and alluded
to here by Justinian (partim in usu esse desiit), in particular acquiring ⁸
the property of secrecy. The will in procinctu, common a lew years
before the conquest ol Numantia, Velleius Patere. 2. 5, was obsolete in
the time ol Cicero, de nat. deor. 2. 3.

§a 'lhis praetorian will, as it is usually called, was really no will at all:
sor a will is a disposition of the civil law, bestowing the hereditas, and
the person taking under it is heres. lt grew out oi the irksomeness olthe
formalities required in the will per aes et libram, and nithe grave injustice
which must frequently have resulted from the avoidance ol wills through
trivia} delects os form, which eventually induced the praetors to uphold
incompleta mancipatory testaments. Regarding form as of value only so
lar as it secured evidence, all that they required was that the written
tabulae os the will should be attested by the seals of seven competent
witnesses: (J ustinian's remark that sealing bad not been necessary by
the civil law seems contradicted hy Cicero (in Verr. 2. r. 45), who says
that the edict required ‘tabulas testamenti obsignatas non minus multis
signis quam e lege oportet '). How sar, and in what sense, such dis·
positions were upheld is deserving of carelul notice, ior nothing all'ords
amore instructive or characteristic illustration ot the mode in which the
praetorian law modilied and supplemented the old ius civile. By the
latter, such an instrument as a mere written document, no matter by how
many witnesses attested, had absolutely no validity whatever sor the
purpose intended Nor had the praetor authority to enact that it should
avail to pass the hereditas, or that the person named in it as heir should
be heir: ‘quos autem praetor vocat ad hereditatem, hi heredes ipso quidem
iure non fiunt: uam praetor heredes lacere non potest’ Gaius iii. 32,
