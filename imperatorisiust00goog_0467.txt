plius eae obligationes, quae consensu contrahuntur, contraria
voluntate dissolvuntur. nam si Titius et Seius inter se con-
senserunt, ut fundum Tusculanum emptum Seius haberet
centum aureorum, deinde re nondum secuta, id est neque

or other not enforceable by action. But two obligations are essential;
it there is not one to novate, the attempted novation is null ; is there is
one to novate, but the novating contract is void (e g. ‘si id quod tu mihi
debeas, a peregrino, cum quo sponsus communio non est, spondes verbo
stipulatus sim’ Gaius iii 179), the former is altogether unafiected

'ibe promiscui a slave ordinarily created a natural obligation, and
consequently‚ as Servius Sulpicius argued (Gaius, loc. cit), it is hard to
see why it should have no novative eflect3 the explanation given by
Theophilus is ὅτι ποιεῖ inflatiora οὔ μόνον τὸ τίκτεσθαι φυσικὴν ε’νοχήν, ἀλλὰ
καὶτὸ ὑπεῖναι πρόσωπον· ἅπρόσωποι· δέ ὅ δοῦλος.

The rute that, is the parties to the new contract are the same, a
novation ensues only it it contains ‘novi quid,’ holds only where the
novated obligation was itscls verbal. tf it had been otherwise, novation
would have been disabled from discharging one of its most valued
functions‚ via the substitution of obligations pursued by actions stricti
iuris for obligations ensurceable only by actio ex lide bona. The Procu-
lians were ol opinion that the adiectio or detractio os a surety in the new
contract was not sufficient to support a novarien, Gaius iii. 178.

Por condicio and dies see on Tit. r 5. 2 and 4 supr.

Servius Sulpicius had held that a conditional stipulation novated an
unconditional contract whether the condition was sulfilled or not, Gaius
(iii. 179) thought that the old contract subsisted until the condition os the
new one was sultilled, but suggests that ii the creditor sued upon it before
such tulfilment he might be met by exceptio doli or pacti, and this was
soon recogniscd as law, Dig. 23· 3. 503 ib. 83; 12. 1. 363 though Labeo
(Dig. 23. 3. 80) had thought otherwise.

Among the praesumptiones or evidence upon which the jurists relied
to prove that there was animus novandi was, according to the Sabinian
school, the addition olasurcty (cs. Dig. 2. 14 30. 1) 3 for the presumptions
against such intention see Dig. 46. 2. 6. pr. and 1. 3 45. 1. 58. Justinian’s
own cnactment is in Cod. 8. 42. 8 ς his statement that, unless the inten-
tion to novate was express (‘nisi ipsi specialiter remiserint quidem priorem
obligationem et hoc expresserint, quod secundam magis pro anterioribus
elegerint' Cod. loc cit), the two obligations should subsist side by side is
apparently subject to the qualification that when one was tulfilled the
other was ipso iacto extinguished; see Dig. 46. 2. 8. 5.

5 4. When the res was no longer integra, an agreement between the
parties to be off their bargain did not merely extinguish the obligation:
it rather operated as a new contract which bound the one in whose
favour performance had taken place to restore the other in statum quo,
