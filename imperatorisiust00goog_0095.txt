ponding to these are described the modes in which patria potestas
may be dissolved, and a person alieni may become sui iuris (Title ra),
most of which may be grouped together under the three kinds ol
capitis deminutio, which is described in Title 16, rsther out of its
proper place. The guidance and control which children require in
their tender years is naturally provided by the care os the lathem but
to meet the contingency of the latter's death while a child is stil
impubes, and especially to protect his proprietary interests, the Roman
law established various forms of guardianship, to which the reader is
introduced by a further distinction ol persons sui iuris into those who
have a tutor or curator, and those who act entirely for themselves
(Title 13). The various forms of guardianship are treated in the
succeeding titles, and the functions ol a guardian, together with the
limits of their necessary eretriae, are touched on in Title ar. Title aa
relates to the modes in which guardianship is terminated, and Title ²3
to cummis, or persons appointed by the magistrate to manage the
property of various classes os persons—minors over the age ol puberty,
lunatics, interdicted prodigals and others who, stom some mental
or bodily infirmity, are incapable os adequately attending to their
own affairs. Title 24 describes the circumstances under which
guardians and curators have to give security for the due administration
of their office, the nature of such security, and the liability ol magis-
trates who neglect to exact it when they appoint these functionaries.
Lastly, in Title 25, it is pointed out that the duties of guardians aad
curators are oi a public nature, and cannot, as a general rule, be
declined by any one called upon to undertalre thern; certain grounds
of excuse however were recognised by law, and these are enumerated
in detail.

The very exhaustive treatment which the status familiae, as oon·
trasted with libertas and civitas, obtains in Gaius and the Institutes
os Justinian has led Savigny t0 regard the ‘ius quod ad personas
pertinet’ as merely family law, and to maintain that such was the
meaning which those writers themselves attributed to it. He examines
the view that the real subject of their first boolr is status, though
not exactly in the sense in which we have understood the terrm
that is to say, he distinguishes status into natural and civil; by the
latter he means the three great status to which alone we bave given
our attenti0n3 hythe former he would express the differences which
exist among persons as subjects of rights and duties on account oi
differences of age, serr, health, etc This, oi course, is aperversion
