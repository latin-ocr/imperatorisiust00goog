, the head of the formula, after the appointment of the iudex,whenc'e
their name praescriptiones. This was frequently the ease when the
defendant’s contentiori was that the action ought not to be tried at
all, because it would prejudge a ‘causa maior' (praescriptio prae·
iudicii); and the purpose of thus placing' the objection in the fore-
ground was to indicate to the iudex that he was first to examine into
its truth or falsehood, and if he found it well-grounded, to suspend
the hearing until it was removed by the decision of the larger suit
Other objections of the same character were that the action was
beyond the competence of the court (praescriptio fori), or was barred
by lapse of time (praescriptio temporis) 3 and the actual form they
took was the same as that of praescriptiones pro actore (p. 628 supa),
vinea res agatur, etc: see Gaius iv. 133. The practice of for-
mulating such objections merely as exceptiones had commenced aa
early as Cicero (de invent ii. ao), and Gaius tells us (iv. 133) that in
his time praescriptiones of this kind were entirely obsolete: in speciem
exceptionis deducuntur. The change was material; for now, if the
defence was established, the defendant was entitled to acquitta13-
whereas before, when it took the form oi a praescriptio, the hearing
was only suspended, and he might be condemned alter all.

The proceedings in iure may now be imagined at an end. Their
object was to formally define the issues to be tried in the action; to
give a legal form to a dispute which had hitherto existed only asa
matter of fact. When this had been done, and the formula finally
drawn up, the magistrate had no more to do; he was said ‘iudicium ,
dare,' the ‘res' was ‘in iudicium deducta ;' iudicium takes the place
ol ius. This stage in the proceedings, at which the action passed
from praetor to iudea, or, according to Roman ideas, at which it first
became an action at all, was called litis contestatio; no longera
solemn appeal to witnesses, but merely a name retained for con-
venience salte from the older system to marlr a moment most eventsul
for the parties, and attended by important consequences which are

described in detail by Mr. Poste ¹.

¹ Note on Gaius iii. 180. Briefly, the effecte of litis contestatio in the formulary
period are as follow :-

(1) It consumes the plaintifi's right of action: res in iudicium deducta est, and
de eadem re bis experiri non licet. (a) lt isin its nature a quasi-connect. and so
(a) ‘novates' the preexisting obligation between the parties: (b) engenders an obli·

nation by being supposed to be followed immediately by judgment: see Poste,
p tio (5) It converte the object of the suit into ‘res litigiosa.' and thus makes
