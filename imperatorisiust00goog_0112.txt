Few subjeets have been so much disputed, and we may perhaps
say misunderstood, by modern jurists, as tlre nature of customary law,
its validity, 3ηά the relation (if the two terms are to be distinguished)
between customary law and custom That custom ever has any force as
positive law is vehemently denied by Austin 3 until it receives the impress
of the judge or legislator, it is only positive morality (Jurisprudence p. 37);
when it has received that impress it ceases to be cusyom 3ηά becomes
positive law, though the name ‘customary law’ for it is convenient as
perhaps suggesting the ground on which it has been invested with a legal
sanction (ib. p. 204). The error of this view (which Austin himself admits
runs counter to all the utterances of the Roman jurists) has been shown
by Sir H. Maine (EarlyHistory of Institutions, lectures 12 and 13) to have
originated in nostine habit of besing his generalisations on observations
only of Western communities, in which the engrossing power of direct
legislation had been kept in men’s memories by traditions of the Roman
Empire. As to the way in which costum, as law (ie. before it is em·
bodied in legislation direct or indirect), is generated, 3ηά how it acquires
its binding force, there have also been great differences of opinion. 'she
question is reallyas to the relation between the usage, 3ηά the conscious·
ness that that usage is 3 right one, 3ηά one which (legally) ought to be
followed, or as to the relation between the usage 3ηά the binding rule, or,
as it is sometimes shortly though unhappily expressed, between custom
3ηά law. The earlier view was that customary law is law generated by
costum, diuturnus usus. ln this or that relation of life, people follow
3 uniform practice, 3ηά this practice, in virtue of its uniformity, is called
a custom; before long it gains so strong a hold upon the mind as to be
followed as law, and in fact to become law, which the Courts (the protec-
tion of security, 3ηά attainnrent of fixity of relations, being part of their
business) will enforce. Custom is thus said‘ to be a source of law,
3ηά law proper, in the history of nearly every natine, to be preceded by
custom.

Savigny was the author (Syst. i. p. 34 sq.) of the view, now generally
accepted by German jurists, that custorn is not one of the sources of law,
but only its token or external manifestation; the law itself is grounded
on the common legal consciousness of the nation. If the people, as
a people, is conscious ofa mle, or thinks that such or such a principle
ought to be followedas lew, this principle so asserts itselfas to be applied
3ηά developed; the usage is thus evolted and occasioned by the principle
which the popular mind approves and accepts, instead of being itself the
source of that principle. The consciousness of the rule must precede the
usage or eustonu for it is upon this that the uniformity of action is based:
