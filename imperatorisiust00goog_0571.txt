558 INSTITUYIONUM LIBRI QUATTUOR. [Lib. lv.

5 Ceterum dubium non est, quin is quoque, qui iussu domini
contraxerit cuique institoria vel exercitoria actio competit,
de peculio deque eo, quod in rem domiui versum est, agere
possit: sed erit stultissimus, si omissa actione, qua facillime
solidum ex contractu consequi possit, se ad difficultatem
perducat probandi in rent domini versum esse, vel habere
servum peculium et tantum habere, ut solidum sibi solvi
possit. Is quoque, cui tributoria actio competit, aeque de
peculio et in rem verso agere potest: sed sane huic modo

ou the strength of peculium castrense or quasi-castrense, Dig. 49. 17. 18.
5. Here the creditor is enabled to sue the dominus by the actio de
peculio et in rem verso, in which two questions usually lie lor the judge's
consideration; (1) has the master himself derived any material advantage
from the coutract iu questioni No stress can here be laid on the language
os the text above, which suggests that the dominus was liable only il the
expenditure os the slave upon his affairs was necessary (necessario...
rem necessariam) ς in Dig. 15. 3. 3. 2 and 43 ib. 5. pr. and 2 expenditure
which is utilis, aud in 3. 4 ol the same Title an outlay which merely ‘ad
voluptatem domini spectat ³ is said to be recoverable hyde iu rem verso ς
and in lact this action lay wherever actio mandati or negotiorum
gestorum would lie: ‘et regulariter dicimus totiens de iu rem verso esse
actionem, quibus casibus procurator mandati, vel qui negotia gessit, nego·
tiorum gestorum haberet actionem, quotiensque aliquid consumsit servus,
ut aut meliorem rem dominus habuerit, aut non deteriorem ’ Dig. t 5. 3. 5
2. ll in rem versio in this sense could be established, the masters own
means were liable pro tant03 aud the advantage which he had derived
might have been so great that the creditor might conceivably obtain
lull payment in this manner, as e. g. where the slave had borrowed sol,
and spent the whole of it iu paying his masters debts. But (2) it the
master has derived no material benerit from the slave’s contract, or at
least uot enough to make him liable to the creditor in solidum, the judge
has to inquire into the amount of the slave’s peculium (deducting the
master's own claims against it), and to condemn the domiuus to pay the
creditor from it what is due to him, so lar as it extends at the date os the
condemnation, Dig. 15. 1. 30. pr. The master’s liability to de peculio
lasted sor an annus utilis after the slave was alienated or manumitted,
Dig. 15. 2. The reason why the domiuus here enjoyed the privilege,
which he did not possess under the circumstances described in ξ 3 supr,
olpaying his own claims against the slave from the peculium in lull, was
the lact that here the contract had in uo way been sanctioued by him.
For vicarii servi see on Bk. ii. 20. 17 supr. ‘ Id, quod ipsis (sc. vicariis)
debet ordinarius servus, non deducetur de peculio ordinarii servi, quia
peculium eorum in peculio ipsius est :¹ ci. Theophilus, ἵνα μὴ τὸ αὐτὸ
πρόσωπον εὑρεθῇ δύο ἐνάντια ποιοῦν, καὶ αὔξον καὶ ἇπομειοῦν τὸ peculium.
