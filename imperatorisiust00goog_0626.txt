EARLIER HIS T ORl' OF ROMAN CIVIL PROCEDURE. 613

geologist is enabled in some measure to reconstruct the natural history
of past ages, so in the language ol the Romans, ss well as in their
law, we find unmistakable testimony that, among the men from
whom their race descended, and before the state yet existed even in
embryo, the world, which we conceive as ruled by law, was ruled by
force, and by personal force alone each man's position was determined„
Might, il not right, is at least her mother ; there being no state

machinery sor the protection os lile and property, man bas either to ·

suffer his own effacement, or to keep with the strong arm that which
he has won by his labour or his blood: and the essence of early ideas
lies in the absence oi any basis lor right and law other than the
individual consciousness‚ and the consequent necessity ol seli-asser-
tion: ‘in sich selbst triigt der Einzelne den Grund seines Rechts,
durch sich selbst muss er es schdtzen¹.'

Space does not allow us to cite more than aiew os the most
striking laets oi law and language in support oi this statement
Thus, the origin and true ground os dominium, or lawlul control over
objects of enjoyment, is placed by the Romans in the idea, not os
mere occupatiori or peaceable discovery, but oi ‘taking’ or sorcible
seiaure: ‘maxime sua esse credebant’ says Gaius (iv. ro), ‘quae ex
hostibus cepissent3’ and perhaps the earliest term by which they
denoted property (mancipium) at once arrests the attention, combin-
ing, as it does, with the idea os ‘taking' another term, manus, which,
as we shall see, is no less valuable evidence ol primitive ideas3 pro-
perty is that which is taken by strength ol arm ². Precisely the same
thought reappears in the early lorrn oi conveyance ; the property was
deemed to pass not so much in virtue oi the will ol the parties, or of
delivery by the one to the other, as by the ‘taking’ ol the object by
the latter (mancipatio); original is symbolised in derivative acqui·
sition. Sir Henry Maine (Early History oi Institutions p. 253) refers
to Mr. McLennan's work on ‘Primitive Marriage‚' to show ‘that a
large part oi mankind still simulate in their marriage ceremonies the
carrying off the bride by violence, and thus preserve the memory oi
the reign oi force which, at all events as between tribe and tribe, pre-
ceded everywhere the reign oi law;' that this was usual among the
early Romans might have been conjectured irom the legend ol the
