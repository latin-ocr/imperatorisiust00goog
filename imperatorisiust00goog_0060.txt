THE EARLIER JURISTS-SABINIANS δ’ PROCULIANS. 47

having nothing but ‘a beggarly account of scraps and fragments ¹.'
There are points of resemblance which maire a comparison between the
development of law at Rome by the prudentes and its growth in England
through avaut series of judicialdecisions,both interesting and instructive;
but there is a difference of very great importance between them, which is
this ;-at Rome the jurists were not usually judges, nor were the judges
usually jurists; and hence it was not with strict reference only to au
actual concrete case that ajurist could make new law, but he could
do this upon a hypothetical set of circumstances submitted to him by
a pupil or any other person; andi, as is remarked by Sir Henry
hlaine ¹, ‘where the data cau be multiplied at pleasure, the facilities
for evolvinga general rule are immensely increased! The development
of English case law, on the other hand, has been merely the outcome
of practical necessity, and from the scientihc point of view is open to
many of the objections which have been stated as against it by
Austin⁸. The Roman jurisprudence owed· its perfection precisely
to the fact that in it theory and practice were never in a constant
state of antagonism; whereas in England the practical disregard of
the one in favour of the other, or injudicious efforts at reconciliation,
have often had the effect of at once maning the theory, and pervert-
ing the practice.

As has been observed, the first Roman jurist who can be credited
with a genuine scientific treatment and exposition of the law was
Q. Mucius Scaevola, who ‘ius civile primus constituit generatim in
libros decem et octo redigendo' (Pomponius in Dig. r. a. a. μ).
From another work of his, Liber singularis ὅρων (definitions), there are
four excerpts in the Digest C. Aquilius Gallus, Cicero’s colleague in
the praetorship, to whom are due the enceptio doli, postumi Aquiliani,
and the Aquilian stipulatiou (inst. iii. ²9· a), was Scaevola’s most cele·
brated auditor, and himself the teacher of Servius Sulpicius Rufus,
consul ac. 51, whom Cicero calls the first of all jurists, and who in
his discussions of legal questions followed a logical rnethod which
gave a powerful impulse to the scientific treatment of law. Among
the jurists of Cicero's age who composed works on the subject are
Aufidius Namusa, Aulus Ofilius (author of the first commentaryon the
edict), Alfenus Varus, C. Trebatius Testa, Aulus Cascellius, Q. Tubero,
and Aelius Gallus.
