their legacies ought to be paid in full, for even so the heirs between
them will get far more than a fourth of the whole inheritance. B argues
that they ought not, for else he will not geta clear fourth, hut only an
eighth, of his own share. B's argument prevails, each heir being entitled
separately to claim the Falcidian fourth on his share of the inheritance,
even though the legatees collectively thus get less than the three-fourths
to which they are apparently entitled under the statute.

lfB had refused to accept, C would by accrual have had two distinct
shares in the same inheritance, and as this might happen in other ways,
it is important to determine how the Falcidian fourth is calculated, if
necessary, in such cases. Three different modes of such calculation are
found in the authorities. (1) Τὴε several shares in the inheritance, and
the legacies charged upon them respectively, are taken in the aggregate,
and a fourth deducted from that aggregate only. (2) The several shares
are regarded as still belonging to different heirs, and the maxim stated
in this section is applied to them severally. (3) They are still lrept
separate, and the fourth is calculated on each share by itself: but the
excess on some shares is allowed to benefit the legatees whose bequests
are charged on others, but not vice versa. This is the principle applied
in the case of accrual between B and C supposed; the legatees whose
bequests are charged on the heir who takes (C) are benefited by the
surplus (if there be one) on the share of the heir who refuses, but not
conversely, ‘quod si alterutro eorum deficiente alter heres solus extiterit,
utrum perinde ratio legis Falcidiae habenda sit, acsi statim ab initio is
solus heres institutus esset, an singularum portionum separatim causae
spectandae sunt? et placet, si·eius pars legatis exhausta sit, qui heres
extiterit, adiuvari legatarios per deficientem partem. ..si vero defecta
pars fuerit exhausta, perinde in ea ponendam rationem legis Falcidiae,
atque si ad eum ipsum pertineret, a quo defecta fieret’ Dig. 35. 2. 78.
We find the same system in cases of substitution. The first method ot
calculating the fourth is found pure and simple only where the same
heres is instituted to different shares (‘ex variis portionibus' Dig. 35. 2.
ιι. 7) in the same inheritance, though we often see it in combination
with the second (as in the case of accrual); the second applies by itself
where one of two c0·heirs becomes heir to, or otherwise entitled to the
share of, the other after acceptance, ‘si coheredem meum post aditam
hereditatem adrogavero, non dubitatur quin separandae sint portiones,
perinde atque si coheredi meo heres extitissem' Dig. 35. a. 1. 15.
' §2- The mode in which the fourth was ascertained was as follows.
