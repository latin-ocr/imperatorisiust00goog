636 EXCURSUS X.

in personam based upon a wager. The claimant of property chal-
lenged his opponent to a bet upon the title: si hom0, quo de agitur,
ex iure Quiritium meus est, sestertios xxv nummos dare spondes?
(Gaius iv. 93); and if was upon this promise that the suit was
brought, so that the action, though its proper and ultimate object
was-a real right, in form was in personam. To secure delivery of
the object, along with its fruits and accessions, in the event of the
plaintilfs success, the defendant had personally to give security (pro
praede litis et vindiciarum), and the amount of the wager, being
merely trilling, was never exacted, whence its name sponsio prae·
iudicialis. For the same reason there was no restipulatio by the
defendant, as in condictio certi ¹.

It remains to notice certain clauses which were sometimes inserted
iu the formula at the instance of the defendant, viz. exceptiones and
praescriptiones pro reo. It was a peculiar rule of the formulary
system that the defendant was not allowed to plead some grounds
of defence in iudicio unless they had been alleged in iure, and the
judge’s attention expressly called to them by an addition to the
formula. Exceptiones are pleas of this character: delences which
do not actually traverse the allegation of the plaintiff, but set up a
countervailing right, rendering the former of at least no present value,
and which, if they are to be successfully pleaded, require (though to
a larger extent in some classes of actions than in others) to·be tersely
embadied in the formula, by an addition to the intentio, instructing
the iudex to condemn the defendant only on the fullilment of two
conditions instead, as usual, of one, viz. (α) a positive condition, si
paret, eto: (b)a negative condition, non-proof by the defendant of

the four ordinary elementa (demonstratio, intentio, adiudicatio, condemnatio) al·

marised thus :-

(al Those of (1) real actions, (a) personal actions which are certae and in ius con·
ceptae, and (3) actions in factum conceptae, have only intentio and condemnatio.

(b) Those of personal actions which are in ius conceptae, but incertae. have, as a
general rulc, demonstratio, intentio, and condemnati0; the iudicia divisoria, which
belong to this class, have an adiudicatio as well.

(c) Praeiudicia tfor which see Gaius iv. 44) have only an intentio. Τίιυε

The Demonstratio never stands alone; it occurs only in personui actions which
have an intentio incerta in ius concepta, and a civile nomen (for in default of this
its place is supplied by praescripta verba, p. 633 supa).

The Intentio is found in every formula.

The Adiudicatio occurs only in formulae of iudicia divisoria; and

, The Cdondemnatio concludes every formula except those of praeiudicia, but can·
not stan alone.
