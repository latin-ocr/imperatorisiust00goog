represented in a money valae was clearly no obligation at all. There
are writers, however, who deny the application ol this principle under
Justinian, on the ground that its original reason had disappeared
along with the introduction ol specific performance: others dis-
tinguish between obligations stricti iuris and bonae fidei (Bk. iv. 6.
28 ini), holding that in the latter regard was paid to the leelings no
less than to the purae of the creditor, while in the former the purae
alone was considered.

(3) The objectos the obligation must be possible of performance
both in nature and by law (see Bk. iii. 19. r and notes), e. g. no duty
would arise froma promise to convey a res extra commercium ς but
one can be validly bound to perform an act at present impossible in
the event ol its becoming possible (Dig. 45. ι. 98. pr); further, it must
not be unlawlul, Dig. 45. 1. 26, ib. 27. pr.

(4) The actor forbearance must be sufficiently definite, or at least
capable of being rendered so; e.g. one cannot be bound to do just
so much as and no more than one pleases, Dig. 45. r. 108. r.

The classification ol obligations according to the mode in which
they originate meets us in Bk. iii. 13· a, and is spoken of in the
notes to that passage3 another division, ot great prominence in
Roman law, requires some explanation. An obligation is none the
less an obligation merely because the creditor is unable to enforce it
by action; there are other modes in which the duty may be dis·
charged besides this, so that the relation sails only in one ol its most
ordinary incidents. Actionability is only one ol such usual incidents,
though perhaps the most characteristic ol all, and an obligatio does
not lose its legal character by reason oi its absence only. Such
non-actionable obligations are said to be ‘natural’ in contrast with
those which are ‘civit' i.e. enlorceable by action ; in Dig. 46. 3.
95. 4, the hond is called vinculum aequitatis, as being imposed by
equity, though the precise relation ol the ‘natiue’ implied in a
natural obligation, and the nature whose law is identified by the
jurists with equity and the ius gentium, is somewhat obscure. That
the jural recognition of such obligations originated in the ius gentium
seems to be affirmed in Dig. 50. 17. 84. 1 ‘is natura debet, quem
iure gentium dare oportet, cuius fidem secuti sumus,' though by some
writers it is ascribed to natural law in a philosophical rather than a
legal sense.

Some obligations are natural ab initi03 iu other words, an act or
event produces a natural obligation, which under other circumstances
would have been civil: there is a reason why in the particular case
