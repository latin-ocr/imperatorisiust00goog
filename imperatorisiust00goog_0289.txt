dcurrit. Sciendum tamen est divum Hadrianum etiam maiori
viginti quinque annis veniam dedisse, cum post aditam here·
ditatem grande aes alienum, quod aditae hereditatis tempore
latebat, emersisset. sed hoc divus quidem Hadrianus speciali
beneficio cuidam praestitit: divus autem Gordianus postea in
militibus tantummodo hoc extendit: sed nostra benevolentia

even with the hei1³s own property, suffice to pay the latters debts als03
in such a case as this they were entitled to apply within five years to
the praetor fora separatio bonorum, the effect of which was to prefer
their own rights against the bona separata to those of the heirs own
creditors, though they forfeited all claim to any subsequens payment
from the heids own property, should the separated portion prove in fact
insufficient for their satisfaction, Dig. 42. 6. 1. 1. The heir, however, is
bound by his testator's dispositions. He may in his will have done more
than institute an heir; he may have given legacies or fideicommissa,
left instructions as to his funeral, appointed guardians to his children
and settled the arrangements for their education, forbidden alienation of
certain res hereditariae, and so forth. All these dispositions are valid
and binding on the heir, Dig. 33. 1. 7. 13 44. 7. 5. 2.

When there are two or more joint heirs, the hereditas passes to them
collectively‚ as a whole; there is said to be a communio in it between
them, but to each of thern individually it passes only pro rata; each
coheres is not liable for the testator's debts in full, but only in the same
ratio in which he is instituted, the liabilities being divided between them
ipso iure, eod. 3. 36. 3. Division of course would usually take place by
arrangement, but if any one refused to concur, he could be compelled
by the actio familiae erciscundae, to which also he could resort if he
thought he was being unfairly treated by his coheirs, ‘haec actio pro-
ficiscitur ex lege duodecim tabularum, namque coheredibus, volentibus a
communione discedere, necessarium videbatur aliquam actionem con-
stitui, qua inter eos res hereditariae distribuerentur' Dig. 10. 2. 1. pr.
Sometimes a coheres could not claim a division without bringing into
the inheritance certain property of his own (collatio bonorum). This
practice had originated in the praetorian bonorum possessio, whether ¹
contra tabulas or ab intestat03 the praetor would not admit emancipati
to share the estate with their unemancipated brothers and sisters unless
they brought into ‘hotchpot’ all that they had acquired for themselves
since their own release from potestaS, Dig. 37. 6. 1. 14 The Emperors,
especially Α. Pius and Leo, further developed the obligation, requiring
that where a number of descendants succeeded jointly 'to a common
ascendant, each female should bring in the dos which she had received
from the latter (dotis collatio), and the rule was subsequently extended to
much other property which descendants of either sex had received from
the common ascendant in his lifetime, Dig. 37. 6.
