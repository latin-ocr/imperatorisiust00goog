(5) Actual enjoyment os the right t'or a prescribed periodos time.
Where a praedium was acquired by usucapio (Tit. 6 ini), the servitudes
appurtenant to it were acquired along with it; but apart and by them·
selves, such rights could not thus arise, sor usucapio presupposes pos·
session os the thing to be acquired, and a bare right cannot be possessed:
‘hoc iure utimur, ut servitutes per se nusquam longo tempore capi
possint, cum aedificiis possint’ Dig. 41. 3 103 cs. Dig. 8. 1. 14. lt would
seem, however, that at one time this principle was not fully admitted, for
alex Scribonia oi uncertain date (Dig. 41. 3. 4. 29) sorbade usucapion os
servitudes, except the anomalous class spoken of on ξ 1 supr. ; but itis
now very commonly held that though rustic servitudes could never be
acquired by usucapio, urban could, as in thern there is a greater sem-
blance ol uninterrupted possession than in the former, and that the lex
Scribonia related to the urban class only.

Servitudes over provincial soil, however, could be acquired by au
analogous institution ol praetorian origin, more fully explained in Ex·
cursus 111 at the end of this Book, vir„ longa quasi-possessio, actual
exercise ol tho right for ten years it the owner ol the praedium serviens
lived in the same province, twenty if in another3 Dig.7.5.1o. This
mode os acquisition came gradually to be recognised in Italy also, so
that in eti'ect the lex Scribonia lost much of its force: under Justinian it
is in fult operation forali kinds ol servitudes, its conditions being (a)
uninterrupted enjoyment of the right sor the periods specified, which (b)
must not be violent, or without the knowledge oi the other party, or in
virtue oi express permission from him; but bona fides does not seem
necessary ; Dig. 8. 6. 24 ; 43. 20. 1. 10.

Servitudes generally might be extinguished in the following ways :-

(1) Destruction ol the res serviens (Tit. 4. 3 ini), or its withdrawal
from commercium. Personat servitudes perished also it the res servieus
uudcrwent a complete and essentia] transformation, Dig. 7. 4. 5. 2 aud 3.

(2) Confusio (which when the usufruct merged in the proprietas was
called specially consolidatio, Tit. 4. 3 int), i.e. the dominium and the
servitude becuming vested in one and the same person. This occurred
frequently in succession upon death.

(3) Release of the right to the dominus of the res serviens, Tit4 3
int. The proper t'orm of release had originally been in iure cessio and
for rustic servitudes in Italy probably also mancipatio: in Justinian's
time a mere agreement (cessio or concessio) was sufficient without any
sonnal surrender. There is some ground sor supposing that abandon-
ment (derelictio) extinguished usulruct, though not other servitudes ;
but its effect seems really to have been to terminate, not the usufruc-
tuary's rights, but only his liabilitics.
