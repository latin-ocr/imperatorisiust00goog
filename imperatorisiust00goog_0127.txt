Besides the public authority of the State over all men, free or slaves,
who lived within its territory, the Roman law recognised certain powers
testing purely on rules of the private code, and exercised by one man
over others, free no less than unfree‚ in virtue of titles which carry us
back to the very infancy of the people. The general term used to ex·
press this authority, which was invariably based on some family or quasi-
family relation, was ius or potestas. A man was said to be sui iuris if
he were not, alieni iuris if he were, subject to one or other of these forms
of domestic control. One of them was the dominica potestas, upon
which enough hasbeen said already. With regard to free persons who
were in some way or other legally dependent on a domestic superior, the

, term lilius familias was used in a very general way to denote them all:
‘narn civium Romanorum quidam sunt patresfamiliarum, alii filiifami-
liarum, quaedam matresfamiliarum, quaedam filiasfamiliarum. Patres-
familiarum sunt, qui sunt suae potestatis, sive puberes, sive impuberes :
simili modo matresfamiliarum. Filiifamiliarum et filiae, quae sunt in
aliena potestate’ Dig. i. 6. 4

Justinian speaks of only one form of domestic authority over free per·
sons, the patria potestas. When we turn to the passage in Gaius (i. 48,
49) which corresponds to this section of the institutes, we find three:
‘sed rursus earum personarum quae alieno iuri subiectae sunt, aliae in
potestate, aliae in manu, aliae in mancipio sunt)

Manus was a power which could be exercised only by males over
females, and which originally could be exercised only by husbands over
their wives; later, women came to be in manu to men who were not
their husbands, but in these cases the relation was merely momen·
tary. The usual case is the manus of the husband, which in many ofits
incidents exactly resembled patria potestas ; but as the moral relation of
husband and wife is different from that between parent and child, there
are points of contrast; e. g. though the wife -in manu was said to be
filiae loco, the husband had not, like the father, an absolute ius vitae
necisque over her; he could intiict death only after a judicial con-
sultation with other members of the family. ln respect of property,
however, a wife in manu and a child in power were on the same foot-
ing; all the wife’s property went to the husband by a ‘successio per
universitatem¹ (Gaius iii. 80), and whatever she acquired subsequently

. she acquired for him (ib. ii. 9o); her liability on contract is touched on
in Gaius iv. 80.

Manus could arise in three ways, Gaius i. 110: by confarreatio, a
religious ceremony in the presence of ten witnesses; by coemptio, a
sale hy the woman of herself before five witnesses and a libripens ; and
by usus, continuous residence of the woman beneath her husband's roof
for one year; absence for three nights in the year (per trinoctium) saved
