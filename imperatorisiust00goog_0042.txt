IUS PRAETORIUM-THE EDICT. 29

than scientihc Not far different from this is the sense which it bears
in certain passages ol the Digest (e. g. 47. 4.1.1; 16. 3. 31. r)
as equivalent to ‘rati0,’ the correspondence between a legal rule or
institution and the spirit ol civil or natural law. In other passages
aequitas denotes (a) the agreement between rules ol positive law and
the natural sense of right (eg. naturalis aequitas Dig. a. 14· r pr.;
37. 5. r pr.), (b) the decision of a legal question with special
reference to the circumstances ol the case (Dig. 44. 14 pnl, or (c)
equity in the modern sense, i.e. mitigation of strict law in accordance
withahigher sense oi justice (eg. Dig. 1. 3. 253 4. r. 7 pr.; 15.1. ’
32 pu).

The ius praetorium, which, as we have already seen, was contrasted
by the Roman lawyers with the ius civile, though equally with it a part
ol the positive law of Rome, originated in the ius edicendi possessed

by the higher magistrates. The distinction between magistratus
maiores and minores was connected with the right to take the

auspices; auspicia maxima might be taken only by consuls and

praetors, on whom ‘iustum imperium auspiciumque domi et militiae'
were conferred by a lex curiata. The imperium carried with it also the
ius decernendi, a magistrate invested with imperium had the right oi
issuing a decretum, os summoning a· citizen (vocatio) to appear before

him by his lictors, ol enforcing obedience to his orders by the strong
arm of the law. Some of the magistratus minores, eg. the tribuni
plebis, had the ius prensionis the right ol arresting persons present
before thern and lreeping thern in detention ; others had neither
vocatio nor prensio. The praetor, however, who, as has been re-
marked, was the supreme J'udicial magistrate, and who by means of
his ius edicendi was enabled to gradually develop a system ol law in
which the ius civile was eventually swallowed up, had little oppor-
tunity ol modilying existing law, still less of introducing new mles,
in the earliest period oi his activity. This incapacity arose from the
system ol procedure (legis actiones) sanctioned by the Twelve Tables
and somewhat expanded by later legislation; the forms oi actions
were rigidly prescribed by statute, and the magistrate had no power
to directly alter or extend them; srom the forms of actions only could
a citizen deduce the rights which were guaranteed him hythe civil
law. The only mode in which the praetor could enlorce a legal
principle not contained in that law was by an exercise ol his irn-
perium; he could compel a party to enter into a wager (sponsio)
with his adversary, and the lact upon which the wager turned could
then be decided in a legis actio. This, ior instance, was the origin
