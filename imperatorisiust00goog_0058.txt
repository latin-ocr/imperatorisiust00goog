WORK AND METHOD OF THE PRUDENTES. 45

difficulties of the calendar, upon whose distinctions of dies fasti and
dies nefasti the successful issue of an action so much depended.
These mysteries were somewhat simplified by Cn. Flavius, who, as
aedile (circ. 312 s.c.)‚ for the first time published a calendar, in which
dies fasti and dies nefasti were distinguished, the people being thus
enabled to know the days on which they couldand those on which
they could not perform public acts; and who also made a compilation
of formulae required in the legis actiones and in the due performance
of solemn dispositions: ‘postea cum Appius Claudius proposuisset et
ad formam redegisset has actiones, Cn. Flavius, scriba eius, libertini
filius, subreptum librum populo tradidit; et adeo gratum fuit id munus
populo, ut tribunus plebis heret, et senator et aedilis curulis Hic
liber, qui actiones continet, appellatur ius civile Flavianum, sicut ille
ius civile Papirianum3 nam nec Cn. Flavius de suo quidquam adiecit
libro. Augescente civitate, quia deerant quaedam genera agendi, non
post multum temporis spatium Sextus Aelius alias actiones composuit,
et librum populo dedit, qui appellatur ius Aelianum' (Pomponius in
Dig. 1. a. a. 7). The mode in which the early prudentes acquired
their knowledge was by attending as auditores, while young, an ex-
perienccd jurisconsult in the practical work of his profession, and
by a carefui study of the Twelve Tables and such other books on the
subjectas were available. Among these may be mentioned those of
Cn. Flavius and S. Aelius, alluded to in the passage just cited from
Pomponius, and works hy the Catos, P. Mucius, Brutus, and Manilius.
Of systematic teaching in schools or lecture-roomo there is as yet no
trace. The influence of the jurists on the law in this earliest period
is of a very definite character, and is expressed by the term ‘inter-
pretatio’ by which should be understood the completion or supple·
menting of the written out of the unwritten law r not in the sense that
they were strictly tied hythe letter of the statute, or by the express
words of the lawgiver, but that they were guided by its spirit, hya

conception of law as a living and growing organism, and by a
realisation of the necessity of adapting it to the growing require-
ments of au advanciog civilisation. It was thenon the Twelve
Tables and succeeding statutes that this ‘interpretatio’ was to hear;

and its operation may be illustrated by an example. The Twelve
Tables had given an action against the owner of a quadruped which
oeused a murnum ; as cases occurred in which damage was done by
twofooted animals in the same way as the statute had contemplated,
it was inferred that to grant sn action here too was required by its
spirit, the action was accordingly introduced, and brought as under
