COMITIA CENTURIATA-PLEBEIAN SECESSIONS. 9

which underlay its application to this branch 01 the nationalliie was
this—that a man ought to have an influence in public affairs pro·

portioned to the burdens which he bore in delending the state
against its external locs. This idea could not be realised in either
01 the two assemblies already existing; sor in the one no plebeian,
in the other no patrician, ever so much as appeared. The result
was the establishment 01 0 third comitia, the comitia centuriata, which
was destined, lor most purposes, to eventually throw the other two
into the shade, and to engross the discussion 01 public questions,
such as war and peace, legislation on matters aflecting the con-
stitution, the choice 01 magistrates, and the decision 01 011 judicial
proceedings which involved the ‘caput’ of a Roman citizen. In the
comitia centuriata, where each century had a single vote, the in·
fluence 01 the richer middle class had an irresistible preponderanee.
ln the order which lurnished cavalry, the patrician votes were out-
numbered in the proportion 01 two to one by those 01 the plebeians;
while the eighty votes 01 the first 01 Servius' infantry classes formed
a compact political soree which could lose or win the day in a con·
tested election, oron a public question upon which opinions dillered.
The political, however, were not precisely identical with the military
centuries3 the proportion between the classes was the same, but by
the addition 01 0 proletariate suffrage the number 01 military corn·
panies was exceeded by the number 01 votes in the comitia by one.

With the expulsion 01 the sons 01 Tarquinius Superbus (circ. 509
sc.) the ltingly govemment 01 Rome came to an end. The act had
been that 01 the patricians; but the plebeians were in 1011 accord with
them, and to the harmony between the leaders 01 the two parties was
due the introduction 01 the Servian constitution by the leges Valeriae,
and in particular 01 tlte comitia centuriata, with all the powers and
privileges lately enumerated. The constitutional iunctions 01 the
king were vested in two supreme magistrates 01 co-ordinate authority,
who were chosen from year to year, and called at first praetors, and
later consuls; 01 the first two who were elected one was the plebeian
L. Junius Bmtus. It would seem too that the plebeians now gained
the artrle to the senate-at least, hencelorward two classes 01 senators
are distinguished-patres and conscripti. But no provision ap·
parently was made to secure an adequare senatorial representation
01 the plebs, and alter Bmtus there is no plebeian consul sor very
many years. This will make it clear at once that, though the plebs
commanded an overwhelming majority in the comitia, its political
influence in general was lar less real than might be supposed. Α
