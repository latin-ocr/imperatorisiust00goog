ei et in eum omne suum imperium et potestatem concessit.
quodcumque igitur imperator per epistulam constituit vel
cognoscens decrevit vel edicto praecepit, legem esse constat:
haec sunt, quae ‘constitutiones appellantur. plane ex his

public officers ; and it has been already observed that under the first
Emperors the form of legislation by the comitia was retained: that
leges were gradually superseded by senatus-consulta; and that finally,
about the end of the second century, the princeps cast off the form of
expressing his orders as the orders of the senate, and boldly carried on
the work of direct legislation in his own name only.

Under this general term ‘constitutio ' are comprised many varieties of
enactments. (1) When the emperor laid before the senate a ‘projet de
loi,’ it was usual for him to introduce it by an oratio (eg. oratio Per·
tinacis, Blc ii. 17· 7. inf.; cf. Dig. 2. 12.1.1; a. ις. 8. pr.; 5. 3. 22);
these orationes were regarded as law apart from the senatus-consulta
themselves, and were cited as such, often in preference to the latter, by
the jurists, and after Constantine an oratio was lrnown as an imperial
ordinance of which notice bad been given to the senate. (2) Edicta,
issued by the emperor in virtue of his authority as supreme magistrate.
Gaius mentions an edict of Trajan in iii. 172, and one of Hadrian in
't 55. 93; one of Marcus Aurelius is referred to in Bk. ii. 6. 14 inf.
When the emperor had become the sole legislative power, constitutions
which, as containing a general rule of law, corresponded to the leges and
plebiscita of the Republic, were called edicta or edictales constitutiones ;
they were addressed either to the subjects of the empire at large (ad
populum, ad omnes populos), to the senate, or to an imperial officer, the
praefectus urbi or praetorio, for promulgation. (3) Mandata, by which
the emperor delegated his jurisdiction to other magistrates (legati, and
the two praefects just mentioned), and which may be regarded as laws
proper only so far as they contained general instructions as to the
exercise of the delegated authority; that they are not enumerated
among the kinds of constitutions by Ulpian (Dig. 1. 4. 1. pr), from whom
this passage of the Institutes is taken, or, in Gaius i. 5, is probably

because the great majority of them related to matters not of private
but of public law. (4) Decreta and rescripta, which up to the time

of Constantine were by far the commonest kinds of constitutio, and
which necessitate a brief notice of the judicial functions exercised by the
princeps

ln the first place he frequently exercised the functions which had
under the Republic been discharged by the praetor: Augustus ‘assidue
ius dixit' Sueton. Octav. 33 ; and these judiclal functions were, according
to the usual distinction, partly ordinary, partly extraordinary 3 he either
appointed a iudex to hear and decide the case, or he retained the cog·
nisance of it to himself, and decided it by a decretum. Secondly,
through bis tribunicia potestas he acquired and exercised an important
appellate juuuiction, in virtue of which he assumed to modify anderen
