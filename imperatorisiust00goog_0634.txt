EARLIER HIS Τ ORl' OF ROMAN CIVIL PROCEDURE. 621

the buyer of a victim ior sacrificial purposes, and the hirer oi a beast
ol burden let out to raise money lor the same object, were made
liable to distress lor the purchase or hire money, and the lex prae·
distorta enabled publicani to proceed in this manner against persons
who were in arrears ol taxation. Ol the procedure we know nothing:
from the limited action oi the remedy it may perhaps be conjectured
that very little was leit to the caprice ol the distrainor, and that both
notice andan interval lor redemption ol the property seized were
requisite. The other abnormal legis actio was called manus iniectio,
which seems properly to have been tbe mode ol execution upon a
⁴ liquidated debt‚ and so available only in the case of debtors who had
either admitted their liability (confessi) or against whom a judgment
had been obtained (iudicati). The procedure consisted in the credi-
tor's ‘laying hands' on his debtor wherever he met him, taking -him
before the praetor,and there solemnly stating the debt‚ nonsatisiac·
tion, and arrest (Gaius iv. ar). Thereupon, unless the debt was at
once discharged by the debtor‚ or formally contested by some one
on his behall, the creditor was entitled to take him away and lreep
him in strict detention, and alter the lapse oi a prescribed period to
sell him into foreign slavery or put him to death ¹. subsequently,
manus iniectiowas extended in all its severity by ststute to certain
other claims; in particular, it was allowed hythe lex Publilia to the
sponsor against his principal, in delault of repaymeut within six
months, and hythe lex Furia de sponsu against the creditor who
exacted lrom one oi several sureties more than his aliquot share oi
the debt guaranteed As thus extended it was called manus iniectio
pro iudicato. Iu other cases again it was applied by stamte witha
mitigation oi its harshness, the debtor escaping imprisonment by
being allowed to contest his liability by action in person5 iu this less
severe form it was called manus iniectio pura3 instances ol its use,
will be lound in Gaius-iv. ag. We read too· ol manus iniectio under
other circumstances than any of. these, especially in execution lor
contractual obligations incurred by nexum, and apparently iu lurtum
manifestum (Gaius iii. 189): and very often it is impossible to say

whether the procedure was pura or pro iudicato. But a statute whose
name is illegible in Gaius (iv. 25l² eventually limited the operation os
marnis iniectio in all its original severity to the cases of iudicatus
(including confessus) and oi the defaulting debtor under the lex
