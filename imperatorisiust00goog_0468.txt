but which was unable to injuriously affect rights acquired under the
previous contract by third persons: ‘[re secuta] non tam hoc agitur, ut a
pristino negotio discedamus, quam ut novae obligationes constituantur’
Dig.2. 14 58.

Among the modes ‘quibus obligatio tollitur’ described by Gaius is
the commencement os an action, litis contestatio, which, if the action
were a iudicium legitimum, produced a quasi-novative effect, termed by
the commentatore ndvatio necessaria; the very delivery os the formula
in the action by the praetor to the iudex extinguished the defendant’s
debt, and substituted for ita new obligation, viz. the legal liability to be
condemned if the plaintiii proved his case, Gaius iii. 180, 181. lt dif-
iered, however, in its operation from novatio proper (novatio voluntaria),
for it leit the original obligation subsisting naturaliter, Dig. 12. 6. 60, and,
as a consequence, did not destroy accessory rights, such as guaranties,
hypothecs, etc, Dig. 46. 2. 29. Of this process-consumption, as it is
called, there are still traces in the Corpus iuris, but the general rule
under Justinian is that litis contestatio no longer extinguishes the cre-
ditore right, Bk. iv. 13.1oinf.,Cod.3.1.13.2and5; 3. ro 1. pr. It
must indeed have ceased to extinguish it ipso iure with the disappearance
os iudicia legitima under Diocletian, nn. 294 ; but now indeed it no
longer enables it to be counteracted ope exceptionis; an obligatio is
destroyed, not by the bringing os an action, but only by its adjudication,
so that we cease to read of the exceptio rei in iudicium deductae, which
is swallowed up in the exceptio rei iudicatae, Dig. 9. 44. 33 14 5. 4. 5:
see on Bk. iv. 13 5 ins. Novatio necessaria is also said by Gaius to be
produced by judgment, sententia, res iudicatu lor its effecte, which do
not belong here, see Poste’s Gaius, p. 447.

Among modes of extinction operating ipso iure, which are not here
noticed hy Justinian, are physical impossibility ol performance arising
ex post sacto without delault of the debtor, Dig. 4ἁ 3. 92 ; ib. 98. 8 ; ib.
107: cf. note on Tit. 19. 1 supr.; and in some cases death of one or the
parties to the contract, as in societas (Tit 25. 5 supr.) and mandatum,
(Tit. 26. ιο supr.): cs. Gaius iii. 120, Dig. 4 8. 32. 3, and Bk. iv. 12.
1 int, which is important for a large class of obligations arising ex
delicto. The operation of compensatio (set-off) is a matter of some
little difficulty: see on Bk. iv. 6. 30 ins. Confusio (p- 275 supr.) operated
in this way is the deceased’s heir was the sole debtor or sole creditor to
the obligation in question, because one of the prime requirements of an
obligatio, two persons, is no longer satisfied, Dig. 4⁶· 3. 95. 2; but this
would be exemplified under Justinian only when the heres, being debtor
or creditor of the deceased, did not malie an inventory‚ see p. 277 supr.
Where the heir was one ol two or more correal or solidary debtors or
creditors of the deceased it was otherwise: see Dig. 46. 1. 71. pr. cited
