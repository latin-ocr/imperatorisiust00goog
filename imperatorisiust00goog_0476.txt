the creditoris unable to sue. Two such reasons have a very ex-
tensive operation, viz.- =

(ι) Insuffieieney ol form in contracta. We shall see that in Roman
law agreements were actionable only il they were clothed in a delinire
form, or belonged to one or other oi certain classes specially favoured;
exaetly as in English law no promise is legally binding unless made
either under seal or ior valuable consideration. Agreements which
neither belonged to the favoured classes, nor were expressed in the
proper iorm, were nuda pacta, and unactionable, although (according
to Savigny and many other writers) they gave rise to a natural obliga·
tion enlorceable in other ways. This is inferred in particular irorn
Dig. a. 14. 7. 4 ‘igitur nuda pactio obligationem non parit, sed parit
exceptionem: ib. 1. pr. ‘huius edicti aequitas naturalis est: quid
enim tarn congruum fidei humanae, quam ea, quae intereos placu-
erunt, servari,’ Dig. 46. 3. 5. a ‘. . . puta, quaedam earum [usurarum]
ex stipulatione, quaedam ea pacto naturaliter debebantur: . . . et sicut
ex pacti conventione datae repeti non possunt;’ ci. Dig. ib. 95. 4.
On the other hand, the passage last cited is the only one in which the
effect ol producing natural obligation ia directly attributed to a mere
pact ; and on account ol this insufficiency ol evidence there are many
who hold that Savigny is not justified in affirming natural obligation
as an incident ol nuda pacta in general. Most directly they are sup·
ported by Dig. 45. r. r. a ‘si quis ita intenoget, dabis? responderit,
quidni? et ia utique in ea causaest, ut obligetur. Contra si sine
verbis adnuisset, non tantum autern civiliter, sed nec naturaliter obli-
gatur, qui ita adnuit: et ideo recte dictum estnon obligari pro eo
nec fideiussorem quidenn'

(a) A person’s defective capacity of right or disposition. Thus,
between pater and filiusfamilias, and between master and slave, there
could be natural obligation only, and even to an extranea personaa
slave could not be bound civiliter. The SC. Macedonianum (Blr. iv.
7. 7 and notes inl.) affords another example: adisputed caseis that
ol contracts made by a pupillus without his guardian’a auctoritas; see
on Blr. i. ar. pr. supr.

Sometimes, rnoreover, an obligation which was originally civilis
ceased to be actionable, and became naturalis (α) In some cases the
praetor, on principles oi equity, disregarded striet civil law rules so sar
as to permit the survival, in a ‘natural' form, oi an obligation which
had iure civili ceased altogether to exist, eg. where a creditor became
heir to his debtor, and in capitis deminutio, ‘hi qui capite minuuntur,
ex his causis, quae eapitis deminutionem praecessenrnt, manent obli·
