THE PRAETORS ANB THEIR EDICTS. 33

oi the ius gentium, partly os the indigenous law os the provincial
population; though, on the analogy ol the edict ol the praetor
urbanus, the latter would have been excluded. lllr. Long¹ says,
however, that they were founded on the ¹edictum urbanum, though
they lilrewise comprehended rules applicable only to the admini-
stration of justice in the provinces They are osten mentioned by
Cicero, who says (e. g. in his letters to Atticus vi. 1) that he pro·
mulgated in his province two edicta, one provinciale, which, among
other matters, contained everything that related to the publicani, and
another, to which he gives no name, relating to matters ol which he
says, ‘ex edicto et postulari et fieri solent! As to all the rest he made
no edict, but declared that he would stante all bis decreta on the edicta
urbana. The provincial edicts maythus perhaps be regarded asin some
way serving the purposes which, for the generalisations oi modern social
science, are obtained by collections ol statistics in various parts ol the
world. The edict oi the praetor peregrinus was a collection of legal
rules which were found to be observed in common by all the peoples
with whom Rome was acquainted; and the formulation ol such rules
would be facilitated, and their number largely increased, bya com·
parison oi the various provincial edicts. The institution of the pro·
vinces, and, with them, of the edictum provinciale, must have given a
great impulse to the development ol the edict os the praetor pere·
grinus; through the medium ol the latter they were brought into
relation with the edictum urbanum. We do not know whether the
work of Ofilius, referred to by Pomponius in Dig. 1. a. a, was an
attempt to collect and arrange the various edicta3 but we shall see
that when the edict was systematised by Salvius Julianus, in the reign
ol Hadrian, he probably incorporated in it some portion os the pro·
vincial legislation (see p. 43 inl).

The activity os the praetor urbanus in this mode of indirect legisla-
tion was due, to avery large extent, to the lex Aebutia, which had cast
upon him the taetros devising and elaborating a new code of procedure,
and thereby enormously increased his power os altering and extending
the substantive law. But it was also due in no small degree to the
exclusiveness ol the Roman legal system, and to the consequent ne·
cessity ol discovering some mles, other than the rules os the ius civile,
by which the commercial relations between Romans and peregrini
