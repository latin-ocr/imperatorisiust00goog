ru. aa] DE LEGA TIS. 287

ait, si quidem ipsi manumisso peculium legatum fuerit, omne,
quod ante aditam hereditatem adquisitum est, legatario cedere,
quia dies huius legati adita hereditate cedit: sed si extraneo
peculium legatum fuerit, non cedere ea legato, nisi ex rebus
peculiaribus auctum fuerit peculium. peculium autem nisi
legatum fuerit, manumisso non debetur, quamvis si vivus ma-
numiserit, sufficit, si non adimatur: et ita divi Sevenrs et
Antoninus rescripserunt. idem rescripserunt peculio legato
non videri id relictum, ut petitionem habeat pecuniae, quam
in rationes dominicas impendit. idem rescripserunt peculium
videri legatum, cum rationibus redditis liber esse iussus est et

at which it comes into existence: dies venit indicates the moment at
which 11 can first be enforced by action : ‘cedere diem significat, incipere
deberi pecuniam : venire diem significat, eum diem venisse, quo pecunia
peti possit' Dig. §o 16. 213. Τ11115, if a man promises to pay rol. this
day six months, he is bound, and the other party acquires a right to have
the money then, at once (dies cedit) ε but he cannot be compelled to pay
until dies venit, ie. until the six months have elapsed ; Bk. iii. 15. 2 inf.
Originally, if the legatee outlived the testator, and the legacy was uncon-
ditional (or the condition, if there were one, had been fulfilled), dies cessit
immediately on the testator's decease : the right was acquired, and there·
fore passed to the legatee's heir even if he himself died immediately after
the testator: ‘si post diem legati cedentem legatarius decesserit, ad
heredem suum transfert legatum’ Dig. 36. 2. 5. pr. ‘ibis was altered by
the lex Papia Poppaea, which postponed dies cedit to the date of the
opening of the will, Ulpian, reg. 17. 1, but the old law was restored hy
Justinian, Cod. 6. 51. 1. lf the legacy was conditional, dies cessit only
on the fulfilment of the condition: with rights arising ex contractu it was
different3 see on Bk iii. 15. 4 inf. Dies (legati) venit when the heir
accepted, unless of course the dies cedens was later owing to an unful·
filled condition, or unless a later day was fixed hythe testator himself :
‘omnia quae testamentis sine die vel conditione adscribuntur, ex die
aditae hereditatis praestentur’ Dig. 3¹· 3²· pr.

No acceptance of a legacy was necessary, in the sense that an institutus
could not become heir without aditio : but one could be declined, and if
this were done, the legatee was regarded as never having acquired any
right upon the testators decease whatever, Dig. 30. 38. 1.

lfa slave's peculium was bequeathed to an extraneus, the latters rights
were tixed (dies cedit) at the testator’s decease: he became entitled to
the amount of the peculium as it stood at that moment, but 1ο nothing
which was subsequently added to it, as it were, from outside. But if the
slave, being manumitted hythe will, was himself the legatee, his rights
were not tired till aditio (an exception to the general rule), because unless
and until some institutus accepted his manumission did not take effect,
and being still a slave he could have no rights.
