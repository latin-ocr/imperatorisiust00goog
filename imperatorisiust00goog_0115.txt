he is capable os becoming a ‘person’ which explains the treatment os his
position in this book (Tit. 5).

ln relation to his master, the slave’s condition is one ol absolute de·
pendence: hence the application to him ol the rules and ideas of owner·
ship, such as the capacity os being jointly owned by coproprietors.
Originally, the rights ol a dominus over his slave were as absolute as
over any other object of property: limitations were first imposed on
them by the Emperors. Claudius gave freedom to slaves whom their
masters had turned out of doors on account of ill-health or disease, and
punishcd those that killed slaves who from some such cause had becomea
burden to them. A lex Petronia (a copy ol which was found in Pompeii,
so that its enactment must have been before 79 an.) sorbade slaves to
be matched against wild beasts in the arena: ‘post legem Petroniam et
senatusconsulta ad eam legem pertinentia dominis potestas ablata est,
ad bestias depugnandas suo arbitrio servos tradere. Oblato tamen iudici
servo, si iusta sit domini querela, sic poenae tradetur' Dig. 48. a ιω.
Hadrian animadverted in strong terms on the arbitrary lrilling os slaves
without judicial sanction; and finally Antoninus Pius enunciated the
general principle that they ought to be protected against unwarranted
severity, Tit. 8. 2 inl.; cf. Gaius i. 53. By his enactment a man who
killed his own slave without just cause became liable to the penalty ol the
lex Cornelia de sicariis, Bk. iv. 18. 5 inl. These laws, however, must not
be supposed to have conferred rights upon the slave, and so made bima
persona ; they merely limited the general rights of ownership on grounds
ol expediency, and their rationale is well expressed by Gaius in the
passage last referred to : ‘male enirn nostro iure uti non debemus; qua
ratione et prodigis interdicitur bonorum suorum administratio) For the
whole subject see Mr. Poste’s notes, Gaius, loc. cit.

§ 3. For mancipium in its more technical sense see note on Tit. 8. pr.

d 4. The general rule ol the ius gentium was that children followed the
condition of their mother, whatever might be that of the father: thus the
children os a female slave (ancilla) were born slaves themselves. Two
exceptions to this which have no relation to servile descent are noticed
by Mr. Poste on Gaius i. 76 sq. In one or two cases, however, anomalous
rules ol positive law reversed the general principle, so that the children
of an ancilla were born free, those ol a free-woman slaves. By the
SC. Claudianum (Gaius i. 84-86) it was enacted that (1) the children of a
free man by an ancilla, whom he believed to be free, should be free
il males, slaves if females; but this rule was repealed by Vespasiani iu
