ol being administered by saving from magisterial caprice the decision

ol most points upon which the successful conduct ol an action de-
pended. The enactment ol the Twelve Tables is also direct evi·
dence ol the independent position which private law had won sor
itsell under plebeian auspices, and at the earne time starts it ona
new career os development; it was no longer the peculiar province
ol the plebeian order; but having been sanctioned by the whole
populus in its comitia, it began to be loolred on more by all parties
as the best security sor order and prosperity. But this is part ol a
subject on which there is great diversity of opinion, and to which
we shall shortly return-the relation, at Rome, ol private to public
law.

English lawyers in particular will sully appreciate the advantage
which was secured by the expression ol the law in amore scientific
and therefore more convenient form than that in which it had hitherto
been clothed. But it was a still larger boon that provision was made
lor its being generally known by all citizens who cared to make them·
selves acquainted with it. Historical analogy would perhaps lead us
to suppose that the knowledge ol the law had hitherto been engrossed
by the patrician caste, as represented by the pontifices, who are de·
scribed in a passage ol Pomponius already cited (Dig. 1. 2. 2. 6) as
the only masters ol the legal rules and forms ol procedure at that
time binding. But it has already been suggested that private law
was to a large degree ol plebeian creation, and the sole possession ol
legal knowledge by a dominant aristocracy is truer of the Greek
oligarchies than ol Rome, ol which we may, with some qualification,
accept the view ol the German historica} school ol jurists, who assert
that the material law was no secret, being founded on the common
legal consciousness (Rechtsbewusstsein) ol the nation as evidenced
and attested by its usages and eustolus. Still, it is of no avail to
know the law, il one cannot get one's rights protected and enlorced
by action; and ol the lorms ol actions, as already ohserved, the
plebeian could know little, through their implication with the ius
sacrum. The decemviral legislation introduced simplicity aud uni·
lormity into these; it was exposed in a public place lor all to
read, and from the lact that in Cicero’s boyhood the Roman youth
was used to learn the Twelve Tables by beart, it is evident that they
were long used as the foundation ol a legal education as, in the three
centuries and a·half preceding the legislation os Justinian, a mastery
ol the Commentaries ol Gaius was considered the proper ground·
work ol an adequare knowledge oi the law. For nearly a thousand
