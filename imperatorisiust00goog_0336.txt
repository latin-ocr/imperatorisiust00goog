tion and the animus domini. No one possesses who has not the
exclusive physical power ο1 dealing with arr object, coupled with the
intentiones dealing with it as his own against all the world ; the pre·
sence ο1 these two marks entitles the person in whom they are united
to the protection ο1 interdicis. This possession, as distinct horn
detention, is called in the authorities most frequently possessio simply,
bnt sometimes also possessio civilis (e. g. Dig. 41. a. a4; ro. 4. 7. 1¹3
45. r. 38. 7); savigny terms it ‘possessio ad interdicta3’ we shall
call it uniformly Possession.

In respect ο1 lour cases the preceding statement requires aslight
modification. Possession is ascribed in the Digest to the emphyteuta
(aa. 1. 25. r), the pledgee in a pignus (41. 3. 16), the sequester or
stalreholder(16. 3. 17), and ordinarily to the precario rogans (43. 26. 4.
ι), yet in no case can they be said to have the animus domini, lor they
⁶ all recognise and respect the dominium ο1 another person. In these
cases, theu, ior the animus domini the law allows the substitution ο1’
an animus alienam possessionem exercendi ; they are termed by
Savigny cases ο1 derivative or representative possession, andare
clearly distinguishahle from those ο1 the agent, bormwer, ordinary
bailee, hirer, usufructuary, and the missus in possessionem (Dig. 41·
a. 3. 23; ib. ro. 1), none ο1 whom have more than Detention.

Possession is anquired by the productiori ο1 its two elements‚ viz.
corpus or facturn (when this alone is present there is detentioni and
animus; ‘adipiscimur possessionem corpore et animo, neque perse
animo aut per se corpore' Dig. 4¹· a. 3. 1. The act by which corpus,
the physical control, is produced, is called usually apprehensio, or,
where effected with the consent or co-operation ο1 the prior holder,
traditio. Apprebensio of immoveables most commonly takes the
form ο1 actual presence upon the land (Dig. 41. 2. 3. t), but actual
eutry is not necessary 11 one stand near enough to overlook it all, sor
here one's control over it is as great as 11 one had actually entered
(Dig. 41· a. 18. a). Nor, to ‘apprehend' moveables, is it strictly
necessary to grasp thern with the hand ; it is sufficient ii the thing
could at any moment be so actually grasped as to give the exclusive
control (Dig. loc. cit r. ar); in both cases it is not the nearness, nor
even the presence, ο1 the object which constitutes corpus, but the
capacity olphysical control to the exclusion oi all otherss, thus,amau
bas not detention ο1 objects placed in his house, is it is in the occupa·
tion of another, eg. a lessee.

The animus domini will ο1 course usually precede, as well as

accompany, apprehensiou. But sometimes it arises later: e. g. a ·
