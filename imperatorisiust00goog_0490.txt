CORREALITY AND SOLIDARITY. 477

another promisee, or to the same promisee by another promisor

. (e. g. adstipulatio and fideiussio): in bonae fidei contracts correal

obligation could be produced by a pactum adiectum directed to this
purpose, Dig.16. 3. 1. 443 45. a. 9 ; (a) from testament, by the
testator charging a legacy on one or other 01 his heirs in the alter·
native, Dig. 30. 8. ις 3²· 25. To create an active correal obligation
by will the testator must state this as his intention explicitly. (3) The
obligation was also correal in the cases 01 express or implied agency
pursued hythe actiones adiectitiae qualitatis, de peculio, de in rem
verso, quod iussu, exercitoria and institoria (see note on Bk. iv. 7. pr.
int). (4) ln a banking partnership the socii were liable correaliter on
all their business transactions, whether entered into by one or all 01
them Dig. a. 14· 9. pr. ; 4. 8. 34. pr.; see on Bk. iii. 25. 9. (5)]0101
owners 01 a slave who committed a delict, or 01 an animal which did
damage, were correal debtors in respect 01 the noxal action, Blr. iv.
sint.

It appears to be the better opinion that a paying correal debtor
bad not, as such, a ius regressus against the rest (Dig. 35. 2. 62 pr.;
cl Tit ao. 4 inl), unless he and they were partners‚ Dig. loc. cit, or
unless, and here only so sar as, they had been benefited hythe debt
which he had discharged, Cod. 8. 40. a. Savigny contends (Obl
§ag-25) that the ius regressus existed in all cases, on the ground
that a correal debtor, when sued, could always meet the plaintifl by
exceptio doli, unless the latter consented to transfer to him his rights
01 action against the other correi debendi, 'and that, when such acessio
could be insisted upon, utiles actiones were in the later Roman law
always granted under the fiction that it had actually been made. But
that the socalled beneficium cedendamm actionum belonged to every

· oorreal debtor as such who paid is sar from certain: noris Savigny's ·

other assumption correct, that in every case in which it did exista
fictitious cessio was recognised: ior though a paying fideiussor could
insist on an actual cessio it is certain he had no regressus against
cosureties, Gaius iii. 122, Bk. iii. ao. 4 supr, Dig. 46. r. 39, Cod 8.
41. 11.

The beneficium divisionis, or right to be sued 1οτ only an aliquot
share 01 the debt, belonged to correi debendi only in particular
cases, and by special enactment: it was granted to fideiussors hythe
epistola Hadriani, Bk: iii. so. 4, and from these was extended to
mandatore, Cod. 4. 18. 3: Justinian gave it to persons jointly liable
on a constitutum, Cod. ib. The effect 01 Nov. 99 on this branchos
law is too much a matter 01 dispute to admit ol discussion.
