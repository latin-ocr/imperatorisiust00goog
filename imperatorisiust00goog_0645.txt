true, the implied right is as clearly brought out by the instructions to
the iudex as if express reference had been made to itin the formula.
Actions of this kind-in factum conceptae—form the great illustra·
tion of the praetorian development of Substantive through Adjective
Law. The earliest mode in which the praetor conferred rights nn-
known to the ius civile was by the employment of fictione. His
instructions to the iudex might be paraphrased thus: ‘The plaintiff
has, by the civil law, no right whatever against the defendant; but if,
supposing so and so were the fact, he would be entitled iure civili, then
find for himin any case! Sir Henry hlaine has shown¹ why this ex·
pedient was at first adopted in preference to openly altering the law.
‘Fictions satisfy the desire for improvement, which is not quite wanting,
at the same time that they do not offend the superstitious disrelish for
change which is always present. At a particular stage of social pro·
gress they are invaluable expedients for overcoming the rigidity of
law! Eventually, however, the praetor discarded his original method,
and began to boldly grant independent actions in cases which bore no
analogy whatsoever to other relations already protected iure civili. The
Intentio of such new actions could not allege a right in the plaintiff,
forthere was, ex hypothesi, no right by the civil law at all 3 but it could
allege a fact or facts, and the judge could be instructed to lind for or
against the plaintiff according as he ascertained the allegation to be
true or untrue ². Actiones in facturn conceptae, in short, are not civil
law actions at all: they are all derived from the imperium of the magis·
trate³. The formulae of those which were of most frequent occur-
rence were permanently incorporated in the album; on these others
were modelled, and thus we get actiones in factum directae, and ac·
tiones in factum utiles. All, however, so far as we know them, are in
personam, forming a third class of personal actions, c0·0rdinate with
stricti iuris and bonae fidei iudicia. The tivo latter are easily dis·
tinguishable from actiones in factum by their having an Intentio in
ius concepta-which contains, i. e. the word ‘oportere :' but Savigny
is of opinion that the more equitable mles and free procedure of
bonae fidei actions were applied, so far as was possible, to actiones in ·
factum as well. Under some circumstances, indeed, a plaintiff might

³ llcnce the division of actions into civiles (or legitimae) and honorariae (Blr.
iv. 6. 3 supr), the latter being those which were referable solely to the imperium, and
had no foundation in the civil law at all; they consist of the two classes of actiones
utiles and in factum conceptae.
