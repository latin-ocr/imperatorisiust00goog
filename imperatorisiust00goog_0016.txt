CUSTOMARY LA W-LEGES CURIATAE. 3

compilation towards the end ol the republic by Granius Flaccus, which
is quoted in Dig. 50. 16. 144. lt is clear, lrom the passage cited above
from the Digest, that the jurist Pomponius assumed the identity ol the
work, on which Flaccus based his commentary, with the original ius
civile Papirianum; but the truth of his assumption is much doubted by
later historians. However, even il we allow that the leges regiae were
genuine enactments, introduced, on the motion of the king, by the
senate into the comitia curiata, and there clothed with the soree ol
law, they were probably not more than formal restatements ol eus-
tomary law already binding. That Papirius,a pontifex, was so familiar
with their contents may possibly be taken to show that they were
merely oi sacerdotal import; and if in lact his collection ol them sur·
vived to the time ol Granius Flaccus, it is probable that it was used by
the later pontifices only to enlorce religious lorms of observance
through its assumed derivation from the consecrated figures ol the
mythical kings ol Roman antiquity. Nothing ol these leges hasbeen
preserved, in its original shape, to our own time, though some of their
substance has been collected iu a fragmentary form by earlier writers,
whose names are enumerated iu the critique of a modern civilian on
this subject ¹.

The application ol the word ‘curiatae' to these leges in the pas·
sage last cited lrom the Digest leads one on to describe the origin
and early history ol the comitia or legislative assemblies ol Rome.
The earliest ol these was the comitia curiata, which, when convoked
lor certain kinds ol business, such as the sanctiouing ol testamenta
(lust ii. ro. ι), was called ‘comitia calata! Whatever opinion may be
held as to the names and ethnic origin of the three tribes (Ramnes,
Luceres, and Tities or Quirites) lrom whose union the Roman state
. is mythically said to have sprung, it cannot be denied that the populus
Romanus, when we first know anythiug certain about it, was actually
divided into three tribes, each ol which, with its distinct territory, com·
prised ten curiae, while each curia consisted of ten decuriae or gentes,
and each gens ol an indefinite number ol lamilies, between which
there was originally perhaps a genuine tie ol blood, which gradually
became a mere fiction, respected and supported lor the sake of the
ancient lamily worship and religious rites. The iamily was thus not
merelya microcosm ol the state ; it was the foundation on which were
based all the privileges which the Roman citizen enjoyed within the
state; the populus contained the tribe, the tribe the curia, the curia
