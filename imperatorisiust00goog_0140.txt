Tit. ιο.] DE NUPTIIS. 127

Aliquando autem evenit, ut liberi, quistatim ut nati sunt 13
in potestate parentum non fiant, postea tamen redigantur in
potestatem. qualis estis, qui, dum naturalis fuerat, postea
curiae datus potestati patris subicitur. nec non is, qui a
muliere libera procreatus, cuius matrimonium minime legibus
‚interdictum fuerat, sed ad quam pater consuetudinem habuerat,
postea ex nostra constitutione dotalibus instrumentis com·
positis in potestate patris efficitur: quod et aliis, si ex eodem
matrimonio luerint procreati, similiter nostra constitutio⁰
praebuit.

legal significance. ln many respects it was assimilated to marriage:
thus Ulpian says (Dig. 32. 49. 4) ‘parvi autern refert, uxori an concu-
binae quis leget, quae eius causa emta parata sunt: sane enirn, nisi
dignitate, nihil interest! But the position was thought a degrading one
' to the woman ; no honesta femina could become a concubine without an
express ‘testatio' Dig. 25. 7. r. 1 ; otherwise the relation was regarded
as stuprum. A man could have but one concubine at a time, and con·
cubinatus was incompatible with marriage : ‘eo tempore quo quis uxorem
habet, concubinam habere non potest: concubina igitur ab uxore solo
dilectu separatur' Paul. sent. rec. 2. 20. The connection was terminated
by insanity of either party, except between patronus and liberta. The
paternity of the children was recognised to a considerable extent: they
were capable of legitimation, section 13 inf, entitled to maintenance, and
’ even possessed rights of succession on the fathers intestacy. By the
later emperors concubinatus was discouraged. Constantine denied chil-
dren who were born of it any benefit under their fathers will, and pro·
hibited it altogether among high imperial officials ; but it was not made
generally unlawful until the ninth century, by Leo Philosophus. If a dos
were given in a marriage which violated the rules as to prohibited degrees,
it escheated, when the marriage terminated, to the Treasury, Dig. 23.

§ 13. ln the tirne of Gaius children who were not in potestas at birth,
owing to the nuptiae not being iustae, could sometimes be afterwards
subjected to it by causae probatio, by which Latins and peregrini, with
their consorts‚ obtained the civitas: their matrimonium thereby became
legitimum, and even the children already born were subjected, by a
process analogous to that of postliminium, to the resulting potestas.
Am9ng such causae were the birth of a child to a Latin father (Gaius
i. 66), and justifiable mistake (ib.67); see generally, Gaius i. 29-32, 66-75.
ln Justinian’s time, natural children could be subjected to potestas by
legitimation, and this in three ways, two of which are mentioned in the
text: (1) by oblatio curiae: i. e. the father made the son a decurio, or
married the daughter to a decurio, in a provincial town. The decuriones
formed a kind of town council‚ or body, which had to bear the burden
of the magisnacies (honores) and other municipal expenses (munera);
