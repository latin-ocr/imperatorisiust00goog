SENATUS COll'SULTA-LMPERIAL LEGISLATION. 41

of urgent public necessity, guarding the privileges of the aerarium
and the publicani, and superintending the treatment of the Italians
and provincials; upon all of which matters it was in the habit of
making consulta to which it required general obedience. Its legisla-
tion was thus at first confined to public matters; the earliest senatus
consultum which we know is that de Bacchanalibus (nc. 186), dis·
covered on bronze in Calabria in 1640. But the party of the optimates
had regarded the senate as the fundamental element of the state, of
coordinata authority with the populna, and had therefore maintained
that its resolutioris ought in all cases to have equal validity with leges ;
thus Cicero enumerates senatus consulta among the sources of ius
civile, and says of the senate (de Leg. iii. 3. 12) ‘eius decreta rata
sunto! The claim was constantly resisted by the populares, though
supported by usage ; nevertheless the senatorial legislation by degrees
extended itself to matters of private la'w, though but little of it relating
to this is found in the pre-imperial period. That senatus consulta
under the early empire gradually superseded leges is attributed by Jus-
tinian after Pomponius (Dig. 1. a. a) to the extension of the suffrage,
and the consequent unwieldiness of the comitia: ‘Nam cum auctus
esset populus Romanus in eum modum ut difficile esset in unum eum
convocari legis sanciendae causa, aequum visum est senatum vice
populi consuli' (Inst i. a. 5). Under Augustus, and still more under
his successus, it became so usual to ascribe the force of law to senatus
consulta without sending them on to the comitia, that at length they
actually acquired the title of leges (eg. Gaius i. 83-86); similarly, the
name comitia was commonly given to the sittings of the senate
(Tacitus, Ann. i. 15, Capitol Marc. ro). The transference of legisla-
tive authority from populus to senate is indicated by the practice of
naming senatus consulta, like leges, after their proposers; but this
was not invariable: for instance, the SC. Macedonianum seems from
Dig. 14. 6.1 to have received its title from an unscrupulous usurer
called Macedo, though Theophilus says that Macedo was the bor·
rower. Most of the senatus consulta relating to private law fall
between Claudius (an. 4¹) and Septimius Severus (nn. ¹93·2¹¹l3
none occur after the last-named emperor. Like leges in this period,
. they always owed their introduction to the imperial will, though usually
proposed by a consul; in effect, they were laws made by the emperor,
though under observance of republican forms.

The emperor, however, possessed the right of making laws directly,
without reference to either senate or comitia This right had not be·
longed to Auguetus and his immediate successors; as magistrates of
