6. τις a. 14. 5²- ²3 ¹3· 7. 27, and lastly, in Cod. 4..30. 7, the term
bears the meaning of a bond or document attesting an obligation.
The immediate result of an obligatio is the partial subjection (in .
law) of one person's will to that of another, the partial limitation of
the debitor's freedom of action in favour of the creditor. If I engage
to buy rocol. Consols, I am no longer at liberty to buy railway stock
with the same money: I must take the Consols, or (which comes to
the same thing) I must pay damages: ‘debitor intellegitur is, a quo
invito pecunia exigi potest' Dig. 50. τό. 108 ; the prominent con·
ception is that expressed in the ‘necessitate adstringimur’ of the
definition of obligation in the Institutes. As Savigny remarks, the
relation oi obligation to personal lreedom resembles that of servitude
to dominium: it is, as it were, so much deducted from the ideal
whole. But, as he also points out, the restriction must be partial

only; if a man's freedom is not merely curtailed in favour of another, ’

but absolutely resigned, this is not obligation, but slavery.

The object or content of an obligation is an act or forbearance;
the debtor is bound either to do or not to do. The nature of this
act or forbearance requires some elucidation.

(τ) The current Roman classification of the possible objects of
obligation is that suggested by the passage of Paulus cited above,
into dare, facere, and praestare: cf. Gaius iva ‘in personam actio
est . . . curn intendimus dare, facere, praestare oportere! Where one
person is bound to convey ownership in a definite object (certum)
to another, or to constitute in his favour, in a mode recognised by
the civil law, a ius in re aliena, the obligation is ‘dare' By praestare
seems to be meant making compensation fora wrong: all other
obligations, including the majority of those arising ex contractu,
are ‘facere' It is obvious that this is not a scientiiic classification,
and it originated, in point of fact, in the technicalities of pleading
under the formulary system, apart from which it is not easy to
understand: under justinian itis amere valueless survival of an older
and obsolete procedure.

(a) The act or forbearance must have an appreciable money value
in relation to the creditor, ‘ea enimin obligatione consistere, quae
pecunia lui praestarique possunt’ Dig. 40. 7. 9. a. This mle origi·
nated in the fact that under the formulary procedure the remedy in
a personal action :vas always damages; there was no specihc per·
formance, and if, on the debitor's refusal to do that to which he was
bound, the creditor’s only means of procuring satisfaction was to
obtain a pecrutiary condemnation, an obligation which could not be
