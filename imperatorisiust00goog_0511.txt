498 INSTITUTIONUM LIBRI QUATTUOR. [Lib. lv.

1 Furtum est contrectatio rei iraudulosa vel ipsius rei vel
etiam usus eius possessionisve‚ quod lege naturali prohibitum ·

in furtum, but in rapina and damnum iniuria datum both penalty and
compensation are recovered by a single action, which sor that reason is
called mixta3 ie. it is ‘tarn rei quam poenae persequendae comparata '
Tit. 6. 19 inf.

Gaius’ remark (iii. 182) that all delicts are ο1 one kind, which Justinian
here explains by saying that they all ‘ex re nascuntur,’ means that in
them the obligation is not produced (as in contracts) by different causae;
it springs from the wrongiul act itselt, and from that alone. The use os
the word ‘res' (for which cf. the line cited from Terence p. 451 supr.) is
unhappy, because it suggests a reference, as probably Justinian intended,
to the obligations quae re contrahuntur, Bk. iii. 14 supr. 3 in the Digest
the idea is better expressed by ‘iactum :' ‘ex iacto actio est, quotiens ex
eo teneri quis incipit quod ipse admisit, veluti furtum vel iniuriam com·
misit vel damnum dedit' Dig. 44 7. 2 5 ; ib. 52. 8. ln 52. pr. os the same
Title iactum in this sense is opposed to res as a generating cause ot
obligations ex contractu.

01 the four delicts here mentioned furtum and iniuria are older than
the others, both being treated in the Twelve Tables, Gaius iii. 189, Tit 4
7int. Damnum iniuria datum was constituted a specific delict hythe
lex Aquilia, circ. 285 tac, and rapina or robbery by the praetoffs edict,
ac 77.

§t This definition requires expansion in two particulars. To rei
should be added mobilis (see Bk. ii. 6. 7 supr.) : and the motive must be
gain; a point marked in the counterpart ο1 the definition given in Dig.
47. 2. 1. 3 (lucri faciendi causal: cf. Dig. ib. 43. 4; ib. 65. Its terms
require some elucidation. contrectatio implies that without an ‘overt
act’ there can 122 no furtum: cs. taint, and Dig. 47. 2. 5219 ‘neque
verbo neque scriptura quis furtum tacit, hoc enim iure utimur, ut turtum
sine contrectatione non tiat 3³ but the nature ο1 this overt act may be
manisold, as will appear helon. Fraudulosa implies unlawiul intention ;
intention,because turtum ex affectu consistit, ἕξ 7and 18 ini.; and unlawiul .
intention, because 11 the person acting hmestly believes that his act will
not be objected to by the person wronged‚ it is not mett: ‘si permis-
surum credant,extra crimen videri¹ ξ 7ini.‚ though whether in cases such
as that ο1 which Justinian is immediately speaking unlawsul intention
would not be a presumption iuris et de iure isa question. The animus
lucri faciendi sails, 11 the wrong-doer’s intention is merely to cause a
damage to the other; e. g. 11122 takes property intending immediately to
throw it into the sea, Dig. 19. 5. 14 23 but the requirement oi its pre·
sence is satisfied 11 the intention is not to aggrandize oneselfpecuniarily,
but to benefit oneselt in some other way—e. g. where one steals a ring in
order to make a present ο1 it: ‘narn species lucri est ex alieno largiri et
beneficii debitorem sibi adquirere' Dig. 47. 2. 54 1. The division into
turtum rei ipsius-usus—possessionisve is not designed to distinguish
