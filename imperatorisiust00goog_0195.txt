, recovered by different remedies; but, by requiring the observance oi
certain evidentiary solemnities in the creation os fideicommissa, by
ireeing legacies from the trammels ‚oi language‚ and by the abolition
of the formulary procedure, later emperors had removed many of the
distinctions between them, and such as bad remained were swept away
by Justinian’s ordinance, that in future the rules and remedies of each
should apply to both indifferently, which also presented an oppor-
tunity ior constructing one consistent enactment from the provisions
of the senatus consulta Trebellianum and Pegasianum, the latter ol
which had hall undone the judicious rule introduced by the former
for the assimilationes fideicommissarii to directi heredes. Many
unreasonable prohibitione, such as tlwse ol legacies to incertae per·
sonae, poenae nomine, and post mortem heredis, were also abolished
by justinian, whose changes in connection with the querella inofficiosi
testamenti, both before and aiter the publication oi the Institutes, are
noticed in the notes to Title 18.
