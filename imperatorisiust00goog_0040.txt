IUS CIVILE AND GENTIUM-CUSTOM-AEQUITAS. 27

allies had been incorporated with the Roman people‚ the limited
rights denoted by Latinitas were retained as a kind ol reward which
could be bestowed on cities or districts outside Italy which had de-
served well ol Rome, but on which she hesitated to conier the civitas ;
it was thus quite clear what was meant by a ‘Latin ;’ it was no longer
an ethnical or geographical, but a legal term, and by Latinitas or ius
Latii was understood a iimited citizenship, which in certain ways
might be converted into lull citizenship oi Rome. The lert Iunia
Norbana (an. 19) enacted that slaves who had received their liberty
in some other way than by one of the three civil modes ol manu·
mission (vindicta, census, testamentum), and who had hitherto re-
mained legally slaves, though protected in the enjoyment ol liberty
by the praetor, should possess this ius Latii, whence they were called
Latini luniani3 but the lex expressly prohibited them lrom making a
will (Ulp. Reg. ao. 14, Gaius i. 22 sqq.)¹.

The character of the substantive law in the period intervening be-
tween the final constitution of the state and the sall nithe Republic
is a subject important because it involves a discussion ol the origin
and nature of the praetor’s indirect power ol legislation, andos the
kindred distinction between ius civile and ius gentium. lus civile is
one ol the two contrasted terms in two celebrated oppositions ol
Roman law, between which there is an intimate relation. It is op-
posed, firstly, to ius gentium or naturale in general, and in this con-
nection it is said (Dig. 41. r. r. pr.) to be ‘ius proprium civitatis
nostrae ;' so too private law is described (Inst. i. 1. 4) as tripertitum,
‘collectum est enim ex naturalibus praeceptis, aut gentium, aut
civilibus! Secondly, it is opposed to the praetorian law which was ⁶
based on and drawn from the ius gentium: ‘ius civile est, quod ex
legibus, plebiscitis, senatus consultis, decretis Principum, anctoritate
prudentium venit: ius praetorium est, quod Praetores introduxerunt
adiuvandi, vel supplendi, vel corrigendi iuris civilis gratia’ (Dig. r.
r. 7)¹. The proper meaning ol ius civile is thus the peculiar in-

¹ Thus in the time ol the classical jurists there were two kinds ol Latins: (r)
the Latinitas ol the Latini coloniarii, which was still to be found in some cities
on which the ius Latii had been conferred, and which contained the commercium
without any limitation; (a) Latinitas acquired by manumission, ol which there were
lour varieties: (a) Latius who were such under the lex Iunia Norbana, (b) slaves
manumittcd under the age ol thirty years without observance ol the provisions oi the
lex Aelia Sentia (Gaius i. 18-21), (el slaves manumittcd by a ‘bonitary' owner, or
hya true owner, while they were the subjects ol a ususruct or pledge, (d) the
descendants ol libertini whose Latinitas had been due immediately to manumission.
