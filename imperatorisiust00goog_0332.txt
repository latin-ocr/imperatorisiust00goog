IURA IN RE ALIENA OTHER THAN SERVITUDES. 319

favour oi many classes ol persons: e. g. ol a wile, or other person
who gave a dos, over the property ol her husband, to secure its
return, and ol pupils over that of their guardians. So too the land·
lord of a house had a tacit hypothec over things ‘invecta and illata,’
as security lor his rent: ‘eo iure utimur, ut quae in praedia urbana
inducta illata sunt, pignori esse credantur, quasi id tacite convenerit: '
in rusticis praediis contra observatur‘ Dig. ao. a. 4. pr. : and the lessor
of agricultural land had the same implied right over the crops: ‘in
praediis rusticis fruetus, qui ibi nascuntur, tacite intelleguntur pignori
esse domino lundi locati, etsi nominatim id non convenerit' Dig. ib.
7. pr. Lastly should be noticed the new power ol pledging the same
property to several persons in succession, though to do this without
notice to prior pledgees rendered the debtor liable to a charge ol
stellionatus, Dig. 13. 7. 37. 1. Hence, too, questions ol collision aud
priority among competing pledgees, which occupy so large a space
in modern Roman law: a subject, however, too wide to be touched
upon here.

One result ol the general use ol hypotheca was the extension ol its
rules and remedies to pignus. ln the time ol Ulpian the right ol sale
had become an essential and inherent part ol every pignus: ‘etsi non
convenerit de distrahendo pignore, hoc tamen iure utimur, ut liceat
distrahere, si modo non convenit ne liceat. Ubi vero convenitne
distraheretur, creditor, si distraxerit, lurti obligatur, nisi ei ter luerit
denuntiatum ut solvat, et cessaverit’ Dig. 13. 7. 4. The remedies
again were the same, whether the pledge was effected by pignus or
hypotheca: so that in Justinian's time (as he remarks, Bk. iv. 6. 7
int), there was hutone surviving point ol difference between them: il
possession ol the object pledged passed to the creditor, it was called
pignus, il not, hypotheca; cl. Dig. ao. 1. 5. 1 (Marcianus): ‘inter'
pignus et hypothecam tanturn nominis sonus differt! The enumera·
tioh ol pignus among the iura in re aliena is thus accounted for:
it isa n'ght in the property oi another, sensu Romano, only qua
hypotheca. '

The modes in which the right was extinguished require a briel
notice. lt ceased to exist with the destruction ol the object pledged,
Dig. ao. 6. 8. pr.: it might be released, without allecting the debt
which it secured, and that either by legacy or agreement interrivos,
Dig. ib. 4. ι; ib. 9. 3: and under certain circumstances it could be
destroyed or affected by usucapio or limitation ol actions: see Dig.
41. 3, 44. 5 ; Cod. 7. 36. 15 8. 30. 2. But as a general rule the
right ol pledge ceases to exist only along with the principal debt:
