ssed non usque ad eam constitutionem standum esse existi·
mavimus. cum enim antiquitatem invenimus legata quidem
stricte concludentem, fideicommissis autem, quae ex voluntate
magis descendebant defunctorum, pinguiorem naturam indul-
gentem :¹ necessarium esse duximus omnia legata fideicom-
missis exaequare, ut nulla sit inter ea differentia, sed quod
deest legatis, hoc repleatur ex natura fideicommissorum et, si
quid amplius est in legatis, per hoc crescat fideicommissi
natura. sedne in primis legum cunabulis permixte de his
exponendo studiosis adulescentibus quandam introducamus
difficultatem, operae pretium esse duximus interim separatim
prius de legatis et postea de fideicommissis tractare, ut natura

any active obligation at all, Gaius ii. 213-14: is per damnationem, the
remedy was in personam only. (3) ln respect of the effect os a gift
ol the same thing to two or more persons disiunctim, Gaius ii. 205.
The importance of these distinctions of form was much reduced by the
SC. Neronianum, sm. 64, which apparently enacted that whichever ol
the four formulae was actually employed, it should be construed as
though it were that most favourable to the legatee, i. e. per damnationem:
‘SC⁰. Neroniano cautum est, ut quod minus aptis (or ratis) verbis legatum
est, perinde sit ac si optimo iure legatum esset: optimum autem ius
legati per damnationem est' Ulpian, reg. 24. 11: though it is possible
that this enactment, while requiring still the use of Latin, dispensed with
the necessity of any set form whatever. Some hundreds os years later
testators were enabled by enactments ol Constantius, Α.ῐ). 339, aud
Theodosius ΙΙ, nn. 439, to give legacies in any words they chose, whether
Greek or Latin, Cod. 6. 37. 21 ; 6. 23. 21. 6. Justinian's own regularibus,
mentioned in this and the following sections, assimilated the civil law
bequest (legatum) so lar as was possible to fideicommissa, the nature of
which will appear from Tits. 23 and 24 inf. Any legal superiority which
either had possessed over the other was in future to be common to both,
and the object os a bequest, whether technically a legatum ora fidei-
commissum, was to be recoverable by the beneficiary by the most ap-
propriate remedy, real or personal. The legatee acquired a real right to
the res legata in every case where it belonged to the testator, and ln no
other, unless indeed the testator himself expressed a contrary intention,
Cod. 6. 43. 1 ; he acquired a personal right against the heir in every
case, and this was secured by a statutory hypotheca, first given by
Justinian himself, over everything which the person on whom the legacy
or fideicommissum was charged had himself received from the inherit-
ance, Cod. 6. 43. 2.
