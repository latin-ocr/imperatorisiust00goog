254 INS TIT UTIONUM LIBRI QUATTUOR. [Lib. tr.

antequam adeat, debet iussu novi domini adire. at si manu-
missus est vivo testatore, vel 'mortuo antequam adeat, suo

nothing at all as heirs, or at least the portion they can take is limited
by law. Between these two classes there is an important difference.
The will is void, ii the person instituted lacks testamenti factio at the
date either oi the execution oi the will, or of the testatore decease, or at '
which he ought to make aditio, Dig. 28. 5. 49. 1, Tit. 19 ains. But
where one oi the second class was instituted, the will was never void on
that ground alone, and capacity to take was required to exist only at the
time when the beneiit vested: ‘non oportet prius de condicione cuius·
quam quaeri, quam hereditas legatumve ad eum pertinet!

Those who could not be validly instituted at all are (1) peregrini ; (2)
intestabiles, Dig. 28. 1. 18. 1, ib. 26; Theoph. ad lnst. ii. ro. 6, though
the incapacity of this class in Justinian's time has been doubted; (3)
heretica, Cod. 1. 5. 4, and apostates, Cod. 1. 7. 3 and 4, (4) children oi
persons convicted os treason, Cod. 9. 8. 5. 1 ; (5) children of and parties
to unlawsul marriages could not be instituted, the former by the parents,
the latter by one another, Cod. 5. 5. 6 ; 5. 9. 6, ib. 27. 2 ; (6) incertae per-
sonae, ln particular (a) postumi ; but the last relic oi this rule, viz. that a
postumus alienus could not be instituted heir or take a legacy was
repealed by Justinian himself, Tit. 20. 28, Bk. iii. 9. pr. ini: and (b)
juristic persons, Ulpian‚ reg. 22. 5. This restriction had, however, to a
large extent been removed; the fiscus could be instituted heir, and so

, could municipal corporations (Cod.6.24.12), churches, and religione

and charitable foundations (Cod. 1. 2. rand 23). Other corporations
could acquire testamenti factio only by special grant from the Emperor,
Cod. 6. 24 8 ; (7) the lex Voconia, 1³. c. 169, had made women incapable
oi being instituted heirs to persons ranked in the highest class oi the
census as possessing 1oo,ooo sesterces or upwards (Gaius ii. 274), though
they'might be legatees to the extent os half the property, Quintil. declam.
264. This disqualification was quite obsolete under Justinian.

Among the enactments disabling certain classes from taking undera
will either in whole or in part are the following :—

(1) By the lex lunia Norbana Latini Iuniani were prohibited from
taking either as heirs or as legatees, unless they acquired the civitas
within roo days, Gaius i. 23-4, ii. 110, 275, Ulpian‚ reg. 17. 1.

(2) By a lex lulia oi Augustus, the coelebs (unmarried person) could
take nothing under the will oi one unrelated to him or her within the
sixth degree as either heir or legatee, unless he or she married within
roo days next alter hearing oi the right. Certain classes were excepted
on account of age, physical incapacity, etc, Ulpian‚ reg. 14- 16 and 18.

(3) By the lex Papia Poppaea, five years later in date, the orbus (i. e.
person who had been married but had no children living, Ulpian‚ reg.
16. 1) could take under wills ol persons outside the sixth degree onlya
moiety oi what was given them. One child was sufficient to save a man
lrom the statute, for ingenuae three, ior libertae four were required.
