Tit. ao] DE FIDEIUSSORIBUS. 413 4³¹

Fideiussores ita obligari non possunt, ut plus debeant, quam6 χ
debet is pro quo obligantur: nam eorum obligatio accessio
est principalis obligationis nec plus in accessione esse potest
quam in principali re. at ex diverso, ut minus debeant,
obligari possunt. itaque si reus decem aurcos promiserit,
fideiussor in quinque recte obligatur: contra vero non potest
obligari. item si ille pure promiserit, fideiussor sub condicione
promittere potest: contra vero non potest. non solum enim
in quantitate, sed etiam in tempore minus et plus intellegitur.
plus est enim statim aliquid dare, minus est post tempus dare.
Siquid autem fideiussor pro reo solverit, eius reciperandi6

others which Justinian does not mention ; he could demand, before pay-
ment, that the creditor should assign to him all rights which he had
against them no less than against the principal debtor (beneficium ce-
dendarum actionum). Such demand after payment was useless, for the
debt was then discharged, and the rights of action, being extinguished,
could no longer be assigned; but if made before payment it had the
effect of preserving them, for ‘pretium magis mandatamm actionum
solutum quam actio, quae fuit, perempta videtur' Dig. 46. 3. 76. As
against the principal debtor the cessio carried with it all accessory rights,
such as mortgages.

ς 5. The meaning of plus and minus in this kind of connection may be
illustrated by reference to the doctrine of plus petitio, Gaius iv. 53. 54,
Blc iv. 6. 33 inf. Α somewhat complicated case is that where it cannot
be ascertained whether the fideiussor has promised ‘more’ than the
other until afterwards ; e. g. where the principal promises subject to the
fulfilment ofa condition, and the surety promises subject to the fulfilment
of either the same condition or another ; il the common condition is ful-
filled first, he is not bound ‘in duriorem causam ;’ il the other, he is lt
seems to he the better opinion that the whole promise is void ab initio.

ὁ θ. independently of the beneficium cedendamm actionum, a surety
who paid was generally regarded as the agent of the principal debtor,
and could recover from him the amount which he had paid, and all
incidental expenses, by actio mandati (or actio negotiorum gestorum ‘si
pro absente fideiusserit’ Dig. 17. 1. 20. 1.); he could do this even when
as a fact he had not paid at all, if the creditor had given him a release
donandi animo, Dig. 17. 1. tot 1} Where, however, the debt was prac-
tically his own (e. g. Dig. 2. 14. 24; 2. 8. h 1), or he had become surety
with the intention, not of binding the principal, but ol doing him a
gratuitous service (Dig. 146. 9. 33 17. r. 6. 2), this ius regressus did not
exist. By N ov.4 1 Justinian gave to fideiussors the so-called heneficium
ordinis or excussionis, entitling the surety to demand that the creditor
should sue the principal debtor before resorting to him, unless the debtor
resided in a different jurisdiction ; in which case, unless the surety
