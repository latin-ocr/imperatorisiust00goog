, from Dig.44.2. 3. (1) The right asserted in the second action mustbe

the same as that asserted in the first. For instance, the res has not been
iudicata, because the quaestio is not eadem, ii what was decided in the
first suit was a question ol possession, while in the second we have a
question ol ownership, Dig. 44 2. 14 3, or where a condictio relates to
the same object which has previously been claimed by vindicatio, Dig.
ib, 11. 6. But, granted that the right alleged is the same, it is immaterial
that the second action is oi a different nature from the first: ‘de eadem
re agere videtur et qui non eadem actione agit, qua ab initio agebat, sed
etiam si alia experiatur, de eadem tamen re’ Dig. ib. 5. For examples
oi difference oi actions involving the same right cf. Dig. 44. 2. 3. 7 (here-
ditatis petitio and vindicatio) 3 ib. 8 (hereditatis petitio and actio familiae
erciscundae); ib. 24 (vindicatio and actio Publiciana). Granted, again,
that the right alleged is the same, it is immaterial that in the first action
a point was decided incidentally only which forms the principal question in
the second, though by the praescriptio praeiudicii orexceptiopraeiudicialis
(Cic. de invent. 2. 20) the defendant was enabled to postpone such inci·
dental determination of an issue which was all-important in another
suit

lt is osten said that the identity oi the object to which the right in
either action relates is an essential condition of exceptio rei iudicatae; e. g.
‘cum quaeritur, haec exceptio noceat necne? inspiciendum est an idem
corpus sit’ Dig. 44. 2. 12 ; but, though it rnay usually be inserted that
the quaestio is eadem lrorn the identity ol the res, it is really immaterial
that the res are different if the right is substantially identical in the two
actions ; e. g. il a plaintiff demands first the whole, and later a part οἱ that
whole, Dig. ib. 7. pr, or ii he claims first an ancilla, and then a child
conceived by her alter litis contestatio in that action, ib. 7. r, the ex-
ceptio can be pleaded with effect

li the right alleged in the two actions is the same, but is based, in the
second, upon a different title {rom that affirmed in the first, a distinction
must be drawn between real and personal actions. lf the action was
real, the delendam was not estopped irorn pleading the exceptio by the
difference of title, sor the right is the same however it may have been
acquired: ‘neque enim amplius quarn semel res mea esse potest ;' and
consequently ‘omnes causae (titles) una petitione apprehenduntur’ Dig.
44. a. 14 2. The only exception to this rule under the older law was,
that where the title advanced in the second had accrued since the
decision in the first action (causa superveniens) 3 later it seems to have
been allowable to specilya single title in a real action (causa expressa
agere), the plaintiff thereby being held to save his right ol subsequently
claiming the sanie property by a different one, Dig. 44. 2. 11. 2 ; ib. 14. 2.
