Possessrotv. 327

different view is taken by Puchta, who connects the earliest protection
oi Possession with the primitive form oi Real Action. In this, both
plaintiff and defendant were, until decision oi the suit, regarded by
the law as equally entitled to the dominium. It was necessary, how·
ever, that one oi them should be magisterially instated in the pos·
session oi the disputed property pending litigation, and we leam irom
Gaius (iv. 16) how such interim possession was awarded. Having
been magisterially awarded, it must also be magisterially protected,
and this was done by au interdict3 aremedy which came subsequently
to be used ior the protection ο1 all Possession‚ independently of a
pending suit.

Mr. Hunter (Roman Law pp. 195·²2²) believes that Possessio
entirely changed its meaning in the course oi Roman legal history.
In origin he connects it with the technical incapacity ο1 aliens to own
property iure civili rather than with the occupatiori oi ager publicus,
and maintains that it properly means Equitable or Gentile ownership.
When, aiter the edict os Caracalla, all subjects oi the Empire prac-
tically became cives, its iunctions, in this connection, were exhausted,
and it ‘came to have precisely the same meaning that it has in every
system ο1 law ; it is a temporary separation between the person
exercising rights and the person invested by law with rights!

There is no evidence ο1 this change os meaning, and nothing to
show that the Roman lawyer's idea oi Possessio differed in the time
ο1 Ju'stinian from what it had been in that ο1 Cicero, or that he con·
ceived Possession as otherwise than the very antipodes ο1 dominium
(⁶ nihil commune habet possessio cum proprietate' Dig. 4¹· 2. 12. 1);
or, finally, that the ‘gentile’ ownership ol the alien (p. 187 supr.) was
specially protected by interdicts 3 he recovered his property, not by
an interdict, but by a real action, fictitia or utilis perhaps, hut still
a remedy which recognised his proprietorship. On the other hand,
as all Possession‚ whether iusta or iniusta, whether bona fide or mala
fide, was protected by interdicis, to dwell upon the close resemblance,
the almost complete material identity, between many cases ο1 bona
fide Possession‚ and Equitahle ownership, as lllr. Hunter does, is not
to the point. The actio Publiciana was open to any possessor whose
Possession could ripen by usucapio into ownership; but his interest
was more than Possession ; it was inchoate or Bonitarian ownership,
or, adopting an expression ο1 hlr. Poste’s (Gaius p. 642), we may
say that the ius in rem, and the interdict-possession, are distinct
though concurrent. The lallacy of arguing that, because many cases
ο1 (bona fide) Possession are equivalent to Bonitan'an ownership,
