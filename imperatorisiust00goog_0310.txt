aureorum patrimonium habebat, centum aureos legaverit, nihil
legatariis prodest, si ante aditam hereditatem per servos
hereditarios aut ex partu ancillarum hereditariarum aut ex
fetu pecorum tantum accesserit hereditati, ut centum aureis
legatorum nomine erogatis heres quartam partem hereditatis ¹
habiturus sit, sed necesse est, ut nihilo minus quarta pars
legatis detrahatur. ex diverso si septuaginta quinque lega·
verit et ante'aditam hereditatem in tantum decreverint bona
incendiis torte aut naufragiis aut morte servorum, ut non
amplius quam septuaginta quinque aureorum substantia vel .
etiam minus relinquatur, solida legata debentur. nec ea res
damnosa est heredi, cui liberum est non adire hereditatem:
quae res efficit, ut necesse sit legatariis, ne ¹destituto testa-
mento nihil consequantur, cum herede in portione pacisci·

Immediately on the testator’s decease, the hereditas was valued: after
deducting the costs and charges specified in section 3, three-sourths os the
residue is set apart ior the legatees, who, ir any one accepts under the
will, can claim this, whatever happens, unless indeed they agree to take
less: but under no circumstances can they demand more. What remains
is reserved sor the heir, whether its amount is increased or diminished
between the testator’s decease, and acceptance by him

For instance, after deducting the costs and charges referred to, the
inheritance is valued at tzool. ΊἹιε legacies charged on the heir amount
to 11501, but all that the legatees can get is 900l., even is subsequently
and before aditio the inheritance doubles in value, eg. by a servus here-
ditarius being instituted heir to a rich deceased, or in any other manner
whatsoever. The only person benefited by this is the heir: instead os
3001, his share at the testator’s decease, he gets (under the circumstances
supposed) 15001, and yet the legatees cannot claim more than 90⁰l.,
because their rights are fixed at the date os death.

ln the converse case of the inheritance seriously falling in value aster
that date, the heir (as is remarked in the text) need not accept, and
naturally will not, ii his share has dwindled so much as to be no corn·
pensation tor the trouble oi administration: but is he does not accept
(supposing no substitutus does either) intestate succession will take the
place ot the will, and the legacies will tall to the ground : it will conse·
quently be the legatees' interest to abate their claims so tar as to make
aditio not unprofitable to the institutus. '

ln valuing the hereditas, all its debtors who were not known to be
banlrrupt were regarded as solvent, though 'only to the extent that they
could pay: ‘cuius debitor non solvendo est, tantum babet in bonis quan·
tum exigere potest' Dig. 35. 2. 63. 1, so that ii any subsequently became
insolvent the loss ren on the heir: ‘in ratione legis Falcidiae . ..
