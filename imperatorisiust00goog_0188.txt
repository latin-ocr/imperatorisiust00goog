INTRODUCTlON TO BOOK ll.

Wran the second Book os the Institutes we enter upon the discus·
sion of the ius quod ad res pertinet. Instead os giving a plain state·
ment of the contents of this branch of the legal system, Justinian
follows Gaius in presenting us with a number of very perplexiug cross
divisions of res, which, however, only partially correspond with those
of the earlier writer, and from which we are left to gather by induc·
tion the meaning iu which they both use the term when they make
it their basis of classification. In three of these divisions there is no
divergence between the two writers. Res are, firstly, either in patri-
monio nostro or extra patrimonium nostrum (G. ii. 1, lust. ii. 1. pr.);
secondly, they are either corporales or incorporales (G. ii. 12, lust.
ii. a. pr.); thirdly (though this classificatiou is rather matter of infereuce
than of direct statement), they are either res singulae or universitates
(G. ii. 97, lust. ii. 9. 6).

The main point wherein Justinian differs from Gaius is his further
treatment of the res in patrimonio and extra patrimonium. T his dis-
tinction Gaius hardly seems to consider of much importauce, for, aster
stating it, he proceeds: ‘Summa itaque rerum divisio in duos articulos
deducitur, nam aliae sunt divini iuris, aliae humani3' res divini iuris, as
he goes on to remark, comprising res sacrae, religiosae, and sanctae3
res humani iuris being either publicae or privatae. Justinian, however,
makes it the basis of a further subdivision; he arranges the res which
are extra patrimonium iu subordinate classes-res communes, res
universitatis, res publicae, and res nullius—the last corresponding
with Gaius’ res divini iuris. Res in patrimonio, on the other hand,
either belong, or can belong, to private individuals (res singulorum);
they seem to be identical with the res privatae of Gaius, and (the
subject of the treatise being Private Law) are alone important sor the
purpose in hand. For the ascertainment of the meaning of the ius
(privatum) quod ad res pertinet, the classifications of res as com-
munes. sacrae, religiosae, publicae, and universitatis may be regarded
as eliminated.

lf we cast our eyes over the contents of the second aud third
bools of Gaius and Justinian, we shall find that, so far as the
