INTRODUCTION TO BOOK II. 181

other parts of the system, they must, in reason, be co-ordinated with
other facts from which the same kind ol legal relation, namely
obligation, arises And from this point ol view lllr. Hunter is him·
sels inconsistent, sor he c0·ordinates with contracta certain other
sources oi obligation, viz. quasi-contract, and what he calls Status,
while he omits delict srom this connection altogether. Under Status,
as a source ol obligation, be groups the family relations ol husband
and wile, and parent and child 3 but the incorrectness ol this had
been long before shown hy Savigny (System ξ 58), who remarks that
these relations, and that produced by contract or delict, are altogether
disparate; the latter being the partial and temporary subjection oi one
person to the will oi another, the former being permanent, and having
a content natural and moral as well as legal: its legal content being
not so much the personal right against the other party as a real right
to non-disturbance by the world at large ¹.

Important changes had talren place in the law comprised in this
second Book since the time ol Gaius. In respect os modes oi
acquisition the ius gentium had reaped another triumph ; in iure
cessio and mancipatio, the oldest titles ol the ius civile, which had
already become practically obsolete, were sormally abolished by
Justinian, who also swept away, in the train oi the latter, a trouble·
some distinction and much antiquated learning. The simplification
of law effected by the recognition os traditio or mere delivery as the
universal mode of conveying res singulae is however perhaps no
more to be admired than Justinian's masterly codification, or more
properly reform, of the law ol Usucapio or Prescription‚ which had
hitherto consisted oi two different sets ol rules, the one civil, the other
praetoriam whose divergence had been occasioned hythe absurd
survival os the doctrine that provincial soil could not be owned by
private individuals. The great change in the proprietary rights oi
filiifamilias, initiated under Constantine by the institution oi quasi-
castreuse and adventitium peculium, was consummated by Justinian
himself ; the survival of the patria potestas was thus made tolerable
by the partial surrender oi one ol its most valuable privileges. The
direct acquisition os possession, and so ol ownership through agents,
had been sanctioned by a constitution ol Severus, based upon a con·
sensus among the jurists, who in Gaius' time had been divided upon
the question; and the interests ol mortgagors were carelully guarded
by Justinian's regulations as to the exercise os powers of sale and
ioreclosure. In tbe law oi wills, apart lrom changes in their form,
