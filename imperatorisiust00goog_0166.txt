mento heres existat, tamdiu ex isdem legibus tutor petendus
erat, qui desinebat tutor esse, si condicio existeret aut dies

recipiunt diem vel condicionem, velut emancipatio, acceptilatio, heredi·
tatis aditio, servi optio, datio libertatis, in totum vitiantur per temporis
vel condicionis adiectionem’Dig.5o.17.77. When the condition was
satisfied or rutfitted, it was said, condicio existit: when it was certain
that it had not been sulfilled, conditio deficit. Negative conditions are
suliilled when the sact or event whose non-occurrence is contemplated
has become impossible ; and in some cases a condition was regarded as
iultilled when in point of fact it had not been : (1) ‘ iure civili receptum est,
quotiens per eum, cuius interest condicionem non impleri, liat quominus
impleatur, perinde haberi ac si impleta condicio luisset ’ Dig. 42. 1. 161.
(2) tf the sulfilment os the condition is prevented by some other person's
arbitrarily refusing consent or co-operation, ‘plerumque haec condicio, si
uxorem duxerit, si dederit, si iecerit, ita accipi oportet, quod per eum non
stet, quominus ducat, det aut iaciat’ Dig. 28. 7. 23: or is the person
entitled on iuliilment is prevented irorn sulfilling by other accidental cir·
cumstances.

As regards the effect of a condition annexed to a disposition :

(a) ll suspensive, the disposition, until it is sulfilled, is there and in
existence, and does not come into existence only on its lulfilment: ac·
cordingly‚ it may have legal consequences even though, through lailure
os the condition, it is subsequently annihilated: e. g. a second will, in
which the heir is instituted sub condicione, revokes a prior one, even
though the condition is never tulfilled and the will asa whole thus never
takes effect, Dig. 28. 3. 16. But rights conferred by the disposition are
merely conditional, and can have no practical effect until the condition is
nnfflted: speaking precisely, there is only a chance oi having the right,
which chance by the sullilment of the condition becomes an actuality : a
contingent becomes a vested right.

(b) tr resolutive, the disposition has presently all the effects which it
would have, had it been unconditional, though these are liable to be can·
celled and rendered null by the future sulfilment oi the condition.

On the sulfilment os a suspensive condition, the disposition which has
hitherto been conditional becomes unconditionally operative, and its
operation is carried back to the time at which it was made: ‘curn enim
semel condicio extitit, perinde habetur ac si illo tempore, quo stipulatio
interposita est, sine condicione iacta esset’ Dig. ao 4. 10. ιι : this rule is
expressed in the formula ‘condicio existens ad initium negotii retrotra-
hitur) On the sullilment ol a resolutive condition, the whole effect of the
disposition is nullified, the condition operating retroactively so as to
place the parties as lar as possible in the position in which they would
have been had the disposition never been made3 Dig. 6. 1. 41 ; 13. 7.
13. pr. ; 18. 2. 4 3. For the effect os impossible conditions see on Blc ii.

By dies, in connection with dispositione, is meant the fixing oi a time,
which may mark either (a) the commencement of a right: (h) its termina·
