agitur. Verbi gratia si metu coactus aut dolo inductus autl
errore lapsus stipulanti Titio promisisti, quod non debueras
promittere, palam est iure civili te obligatum esse et actio,
qua intenditur dare te oportere, efficax est: sed iniquum est
te condemnari ideoque datur tibi exceptio metus causa aut
doli mali aut infactum composita ad impugnandam actionem.
Idem iuris est, si quis quasi credendi causa pecuniam stipo-2

§L For the introduction oi the exceptio quod metus causa by the
praetor Octavius see on Tit. 6. 33 supr. Α person who had been induced
by intimidation to make any disposition (and not merely a contract, as
might hastily be inferred from the text3 see Gaius iv. 117) could either
bring the actio quod metus causa (Tit 6. 27 supr.) by which he might
recover penal damages sor any loss he had sutl'ered, or he could repel
any action brought against him on the disposition by the exceptio (which,
however, was not necessary in bonae fidei actions, Cod 4 44 8), or
finally he might get himself in integrum restitutus. With ‘palam est iure
civili te obligatum esse’ in the text we may compare Dig. 4 2. 21. 5 ‘si
metu coactus adii hereditatem, puto heredem me ellici, quamvis si liberum
esset noluissem, tamen coactus volui.¹

What has been said oi metus may, mutatis mutandis, be repeated oi
dolus ; see the note on Tit. 6. 33 referred to. Here the fraud had to be
alleged specifically against the plaintitl' in the exceptio; ‘et quidem
illud adnotandum est, quod specialiter exprimendum est, de cuius
dolo quis queratur, non in rem, “si in ea re nihil dolo malefactum est,'’
sed sic “si in ea re nihil dolo malo actoris lactum est ”' Dig. 44 4. 2. 1 ;
cf. (of the actio doli) ‘in haec actione designari oportet cuius dolo
sactum sit, quamvis in metu non sit necesse’ Dig. 4. 3. 1 5. 3. Where to
‘nihil dolo malo sactum est’ was added ‘neque fiat' (as in Gaius iv. 1¹9)
the exceptio was said to be generalis.

lf the defendant’s plea was not one oi the commonet kinds which had
received specilic names, it briefly stated the facts upon which he relied,
and was then said to be in iactum composita ε· ‘in iactum λέγεται ἐπειδὴ
διηγηματικῶς τὸ γινόμενον ἅντιτίθησιν’ Theophilus ς so, too, Gaius describes
formulae in factum conceptae by saying ‘nominato eo quod sactum est ’
iv. 46; ior an example see fragm. Vat. 3¹0 ‘si non donationis causa
mancipavi vel promisi me daturum! ln a loose sort oi way these excep·
tiones in iactum were comprised under the exceptio doli: ‘generaliter
sciendum est ex omnibus infactum exceptionibus doli oriri exceptionem,
quia dolo facit, quicunque id quod quaqua exceptione elidi potest petit ’
Dig. 44 4. 2. 5. lt may be, however, that tbe contrast is merely the
old one between in ius and in factum, the judge’s attention being directed
in some exceptiones to a question merely oi law (e. g. ‘si in ea re nihil
contra legem Cinciam lactum sit' fragm. Vat. 310); this, as Keller
remmlts (Civil Process ξ 35), would make most exceptions in facturn.
