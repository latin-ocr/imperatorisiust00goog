Tit. ay] DE CODICILLIS. 3¹¹

presserat non recessisse. Codicillis autem hereditas neque2
dari neque adimi potest, ne confundatur ius testamentorum et
codicillorum, et ideo nec exheredatio scribi. directo autem
hereditas codicillis neque dari neque adimi potest: nam per
fideicommissum hereditas codicillis iure relinquitur. nec con-
dicionem heredi instituto codicillis adicere neque substituere

facto ius sequuntur eius’ Dig. loc. cit, ‘si ex testamento hereditas adita
non suisset, fideicommissum ex huiusmodi codicillis nullius momenti
erit'ib. 3. 2), and as a general rule are read as part os the will itsels:
‘codicillorum ius singulare est, ut, quaecunque in his scribentur, perinde
haberentur ac si in testamento scripta essent’ Dig. ib. 2. 2. Occasionally,
however, the codicilli are looked at by themselves, and apart irom the
will: eg. ii the testator is insolvent, or less than twenty years of age, at
the time oiexecuting his will, and then subsequently, when solvent or over
that age, manumit a slave by codicilli, the manumission holds good,
though it would have been invalidis made in the will, Dig. 29. 7. 4, ib. 1.

There were at one time important dilierences in effect among codicils
according as they were or were not confirmed, antecedently or subse·
quently‚ by a will By unconfirmed codicils fideicommissa alone could
be created: by codicilli confirmati the testator could give legacies (Gaius
2. 270, Ulpian‚ reg. 2 5. 8), appoint testamentary guardians, Dig. 26. 2. 3.
pr.‚ and directly manumit his own slaves: but under Justinian little re·
mained ol these distinctions except that relating to tutoris datio.

lt was usual lor wills to contaln a ‘clausula codicillaris,' by which the
testator declared his desire, that il the will should prove invalid on any
ground it should have lorce as codicilli. Such declaration might be in
any form, and need not even mention the word codicils: ‘ex his verbis,
quae paterfamilias scripturae addidit: ταύτην τὴν διαθήκην βούλομαι εἶναι
κυρίαν ἐπὶ πάσης ἐξουσίας, videri eum voluisse omnimodo valere ea quae
reliquit, etiamsi intestatus decessisset' Dig. ²9· 7. 29. 1. By this clause
the dispositione ol the will were validated only so lar as they would have
held good had they been originally executed as codicilli : thus they iell
to the ground unless the forms required sor the execution of codicils
(3 ini) were observed, or if the testator had not testamenti factio: ‘sci-
endum est eos demum fideicommissum posse relinquere, qui testandi ius
habent' Dig. 30. 2. Subject to this, the efiect of the clausula was to con·
vert the institution of the will into a fideicommissaria hereditas, Dig. 31.
88. 17, binding on the intestato heirs, or those instituted in an earlier or

· later testament. li, however, the ground oi the will's invalidity was vio·

lation os the rules relating to the legitima pars, the institution became
altogether void. The legacies and fideicommissa remained good in any
(5³82.

§2- Nothing can be done by codicils affecting the direct universal
succession. To what is said in the text it may be added, that no invalid
institution could be validated by a codicillary confirmation, however
