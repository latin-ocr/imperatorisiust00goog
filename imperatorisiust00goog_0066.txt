THE ROMAN JURISTS AND LEGAL EDUCATION. 53

that lawis but one uf the agencies by which the life ofa naticn is
developed, and that it stands in close relation tc other influences all
of which must play their part in dufy promoting the welfare of the
social organism. These other influences-literature, what are now
called the moral or social sciences, art, and, we may perhaps add,
religion-they left more cr less out of sight, or at any rate failed to
see the inevitable correlation between them and their own favourite
subject, to appreciata the function of philosophy as the comincn
element in, the connecting link between, the varicus branches of
human thought. As the queen of the· sciences, philosophy watches
over the clement which they share each with one another, by keeping
them before her in orderly review, by restraining each within its due
sphere‚ by maintaIning them in their proper relation, she discharges
her function of giving to each its perfect form, its true development.
This relation between philosophy and the sciences was not ade·
quately perceived by the Roman jurists, because its true appre-
ciaticn depends on conditions many of which are realised only in
the modern world. To them jurisprudence was philosophy and all
philosophy. Ulpian says, ‘iustitiam colimus, et boni et aequi noti·
tiam profitemur ; aequum ab iniquo separantes, licitum ab illicito dis·
cernentes, bonos non solum metu poenarum, verum etiam praemiorum
qnoque exhortatione efficere cupientes, veram nisi fallor philosophiam,
non simulatam affectantes! The words are those cf a moralist, not of
a lawyer; and the failure to distinguish sufficiently between jurispru-
dence and the other sciences, notably ethics, resulted in logical faults,
especially of definition, which mar to no small degree the excellences
by which the Roman law is on other grounds distinguished ¹.

The mode in which the earlier prudentes acquired their know-
ledge of law has been already noticed. After a short preliminary
instruction in the leading terms and distinctions of jurisprudence,
which was denoted by the term ‘instituere’ their training was purely
practical, and consisted in attending a leading lawyer in court and
chambers, and in thus piching up both learning and the modes of

applying it No jurist refused the youth of Rome the privilege of
thus attaching themselves to him as auditores, in order under his
auspices to leam the law; indeed it was considered an honourable
distinction. ‘lus civile docere,' says Cicera, ‘semper pulcrum fuit,
hominumque clarissimorum discipulis floruerunt domus3’ and cf
