the genius of each is supposed to have reflected and reproduced
itself in their legal habits and in their modes 01 life and thought. Such
speculatione assuredly cannot claim our serious attention ; but a
question which is suggested by them is 01 larger interest, because the
answerto 11 will affect our judgment upon the general character 01
the legal system through a great part 01 its history, and will deter-
minefour explanation 01 many 01 its most peculiar phenomena It is
the view of many who have deeply studied the institutions 01 Rome
that, in its infancy, the consciousness 01 the people as a military state,
which had perpetually to be defending its very existence with the
sword, asserted itself so irresistibly as to colour the law 01 Rome to
the very end of its history. In periods 01 grave national peril citizens
always realise most fully their membership one with another, and are
most ready to sacrifice the fleeting interest cf the individual to the
higher and more engrossing requirements of the state. Hence is
inferred a fact which (as it is represented) left its marli upon Roman
law even in the age of justinian, twelve hundred years after, the epoch
which we are now considering; the fact, namely‚ that in the earliest
period of the nation's history almost every relation with which juris-
pmdence has ever had any concern was dominated by public law, or
hythe idea, expressing itself in law, that beside, or apart from, the
state, the citizen is 'as nothing, and that he has no ground for com·
plaint if his family life, his religion, his dealings with his fellcw men,
his very liberty and tite are treated principally as means 10 the end of
government, and placed under state control. The position 01 the
family in the state economy has been already indicated The very
existence of the people, as 30 organis whole, depended on the main·
' tenance 01 the gentes through families ,· and as a new family could
arise only from the lawful wedlock 01 two citizens, marriage was made
a public act and pla'ced under sacerdotal supervision; the solemn rite
01 confarreatio (Gaius i. rra), by which alone it could be con-
nected, was a ceremony 01 deep public and religious import„
Again, through lach 01 children, or through the death 01 such as
might be born, a family might be in danger of dissolution; hence
the supreme political importance 01 the institution led to the recog·

and adoption, too, was 3 public act, accomplished under the auspices
01 the priestly college before the comitia centuriata.

There is perhaps less probability in the alleged extension 10 the
field 01 property 01 this domination of public over private law. The
old principle 01 law, it is said, laid it down that conquered land and
