the will os a husband in whose manus she had been; (2) tutores fidu·
ciarii, in case os a ireebom woman's manumission e mancipio (Gaius
i115 a); (3) tutores cessicii; (4) tutores Atiliani, appointed by the
magistrates. Testamentary guardians were as old as the Xll Tables
(note on ξ 3 inl.); but in relation to women they resembled the four
kinds just specified in possessing hut the shadow of those powers ol veto
and control which belonged to a tutor legitimus. The sanction oia
tutor who was not legitimus was required to validate the woman's dis·
positions, wherever that ol a statutory guardian would have been neces-
sary: ⁴ tutoris auctoritas necessaria est mulieribus quidem in his rebus:
si lege aut legitimo iudicio agant: si se obligent, si civile negotium
gerant, si libertae suae permittant in contubernio alieni servi morari, si
rem mancipi alienent’ Ulpian, reg. 11. 27 ; in ιο. 15 he adds the execu-
tion os a will. But in all these cases the sanction was merely formal:
‘pupillorum pupillarumque tutores et negotia gerunt, et auctoritatem
interponunt: mulierum autem tutores auctoritatem duntaxat inter·
ponunt' Ulpian, loc. cit 25, and the auctoritas of a non-statutory guar-
dian could be demanded by the woman as a matter oi right: ‘loquimur
autem de his scilicet seminis quae non in legitima parentium aut patro·
norum tutela sunt, sed de his quae alterius generis tutores habent, qui
etiam inviti coguntur auctores fieri' Gaius ii. 120, ‘saepe etiam [tutor]
invitus auctor fieri a praetore cogitur’ i. 19α

lt was in respect ol making a will that the woman was most restricted,
the original rule being that no woman could do this who had not sub·
jected herself to capitis deminutio hy coemption, followed by remanci-
pation and manumission, or, in other words, by a fictitious marriage,
Gaius i. ¹¹5 a; she thus obtained a tutor fiduciarius, who authorized
the testament ‘dicis causa,' ib. 190, though in all this business the in·
terests os the patron or agnates were completely secured, ior without
their sanction at the first the coemption could not have taken place
at all.

The only independent women who were exempted by the older law t'rorn
perpetual guardianship were the vestal virgins, on whom this privilege had
been bestowed hythe Xll Tables, Gaius i. 145 ; but alter the lall os the Re·
public important changes were made, especially in respect oi testaments.
The lex lulia and Papia Poppaea, Α. 1). 9, released from guardianship
all women who had borne a certain number ol children (ius liberorum),
and this boon must have benefited a very large proportion os married
women who were sui iuris. Not many years later a law ol Claudius en·
tirely abolished the legitima tutela of agnates over women, Gaius i. 157, and
by a senatusconsult passed under Hadrian they were enabled to make
a will without the necessity os a coemption, though the auctoritas ol the
guardian was not dispensed with. Thus, in the time os the classical
jurists, every woman who was sui iuris, and who was not a vestal virgin
or exempted under the lex Papia, must have a guardian: but his
