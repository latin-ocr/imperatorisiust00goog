22 INTRODUCTION.

magistracy forforty·four years. Seven years before that date C.Licinius
Stolo had renewed the plebeian agitation for admission to the consul·
ship, and in nc. 367 he succeeded in procuring a statute by which
the military tribuneship was abolished, and it was provided that one
at least of the consuls should be chosen from the plebs. The same
date is usually assigned to the introduction of the praetorship‚ an office
which seems really to have been in existence for some time previously,
and of which more will be said hereafter. The praetor was charged
with the administration of civil justice and the general management of
domestic affairs, so far as they had not been already appropriated to
existing offices. The institution of the curule aedileship belongs to the
same period, an office at first exclusively patrician, but soon thrown open
to the plebeians also; the aedile's functions, which at first related only
to certain affairs peculiar to the patrician order, such as the games of
the great festivals, were very shortly emended to all matters, whether
connected with the public health, religion, morality, streets, buildings,
or security of person and property, so far as they could be placed
under the control of police.

Besides the lex Licinia by which the consulship was opened to
the plebs, there are two others of the same name, which were due to
the energy of the same Licinius Stolo. Of these one was designed to
relieve embarrassed debtors by striking off from the amount of their
principal debts the sums which they had paid as interest, and by
allowing them an interval for the complete satisfaction ol their
creditors3 the other was a land law in favour of small holdings, which
prohibited even the richest from owning more than five hundred
iugera of land, and a certain number of sheep and cattle. Before
long too an adequate senatorial representation of the plebs was
secured by the lex Ouinia (circ. 320 nc), which directed the censors,
in the selection of the senate, to choose the fittest persons without
distinction of order: ‘. . . . donec Ovinia intervenit, qua sanctum est
ut censores ex omni ordine optimum quemque curiatim (iurati,
Meier, ex coniectura) in senatum legerent' (Festus). Magistrates of*
cumle rank (consuls, praetors, and aediles) were members ol the
senate ex affirm and retained their scats even at the end of their year
of office, until the next revision of that body by the censors, when their
re-election depended on the view which those magistrates took of
their merits.

The leges Publiliae (nc. 339) effectcd a considerable reform in the
comitia. It has been already noticed that the lex Horatia Valeria had
restored the comitia tributa after the second secession ol the plebs;
