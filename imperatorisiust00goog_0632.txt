EARLIER HISTORl' OF ROMAN CIVIL PROCEDURE. 619

system ol actions tried before ajudge or judges took its origin. The
earliest judges derived their judicial authority, such as it was, not lrom
the state, but from the voluntary submission of the parties: and
Sir H.=,Maine has shown ¹, by art examination of the earliest Roman
civil process, that the magistrate, even when commissioned by the
state sor the administration os justice, preserved the memory oi the
actual historical source ol his iunctions by ‘caresully simulating the
demeanour of a private arbitrator casually called in! The later Roman
jurists, though struck by the similarity in procedure between an ordi·
nary action and a reference to arbitration, were guilty ol the curious
anachronism os deriving the latter from the former: ‘compromissum'
(one oi them says) ‘ad similitudinem iudiciorum redigitur3' but the
lact is that action grew out of arbitration, and the judge was originally
only an unofficial releree; a fact ol which traces are observable
throughout the legal history oi Rome. Thus, no action could
validly be commenced, still less carried through to judgment, until the
court had got both parties before it: sor arbitration can take place ·
only by consent, not by a unilateral act of either os them without the
other. Still more forcihly are we reminded of the mode in which the

judge could be forced upon a party os whose knowledge and integrity
he was not satisfied: ‘neminem’ says Cicero ², ‘voluerunt maiores
nostri non modo de existimatione cuiusquam, sed ne pecuniaria quidem
de re minima esse iudicem, nisi qui inter adversarios convenisset'
Hence too the limited authority, as we should deem it, os the Roman
iudex ; he has no‘imperium 3' hc cannot compel the parties to any
act or forbearance, be is merelya reseree whom they have chosen,
andin whose appointment the magistrate has cooperator, all he has
to do is to decide the questions submitted to him, so sar as the par-
ties may enable bim3 he bas to leave to them the realization (hy exe·
cution) os the right he ascertains. The very point he has actually to
settle isat first kept studiously in the background, and hidden behind ⁸
a wager ; the decision is not an order or injunction, but an expression
of opinion, sententia, pronuntiatio.

ln England we know lrom actual records with what rapidity trial by
jury in civil causes, though in most cases optional only, superseded the
more barbarous methods of compurgation, ordeal and trial by battle,

and that this was largely due to a sense oithe greater justice and reason·
ableness ol the new system. We can hardly doubt that upon much
the same grounds the practice oi arbitration daily gained greater
