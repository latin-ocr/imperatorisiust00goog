618 EXCURSUS X.

a ‘guarantor' or ‘insurer' of the right which he has attested-a con·
ception which we shall be the better able to realize by remembering
the judr'crhl character of the recognitor in the Assizes of Henry 11-;

the witnesses, who in the legis actio are called upon ‘litem contestari:
discharge, upon this theory, some intelligible function1. Why, we
may ask, could a woman not be a witness to the transactione of the
ius civile? The answer would seem to be, because she lacks the
physical force of man to which the witness must in the last resort
appeal, if he is really to do his duty as ‘assuren' Why, again, could
many of a man's own relations, whose evidence might incur suspicion
on the ground of interest, attest his solemn acts and dispositions?
Because credibilr'ty is not, as with us, the essential; the essential is
rather the strong arm. Joint responsibility for wrong is familiar to
readers of Greek legend no less than of tunglo-Saron history; joint

“ suretyship for right-the idea of inducing awrongdoer to submit to

justice by the moral and physical force by which his adversary is
backed-is peculiarly Roman. Α strong confirmationes this theory
is found in the will made in the comitia calata; a disposition which
it was desirable should be guaranteed by a larger force than any
ordinary matter, because it was of far greater importance, affected,
perhaps prejudicially, more interests, and therefore was more likely to
be impeached, and exposed to the chances of stronger opposition: ac·
cordingly, it was witnessed, and so guaranteed, by the whole Roman
populus and even when in the will made per aes et libram the number
of witnesses was reduced to five, these, according to a very plausible
theory, represented the whole people in its live census-classes. lf this
conjecture be true, the form of mancipation was an easy and conve·
nient means of throwing round 'dispositions the aegis ofa public
guarantee: violation ofa right acquired per aes et libram isa violation
of public order: resistance to the person entitled is resistance to the
state.

iii. The contractual decision of disputes took two forms. The one
consisted in the complainant's giving his adversary the option of de·
nying his liability on oath, or of being taken, in default, to admit it:
it remained a permanent institution at Rome even to the time of
justinian, in whose Digest (38.12.2) we read ‘manifestae turpi·
tudinis et cotfissz'om's est nolle nec iurare nec iusiurandum referre!
The other was reference ol the matter by common consent to arbi-
tration: from this, beyond the shadow of a doubt, the whole Roman
