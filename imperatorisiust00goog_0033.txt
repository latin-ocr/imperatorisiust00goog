20 INTRODUCTION.

state, in itsell, had nothing to do with private law; ior their very
purpose is to place the two in a relation to one another which
previously did not exist: and that absence ol opposition consiste, not
. in the domination ol private law by the state, but os the state by
private law: that is to say, the state is constructed on private law
principles. The evolution oi private law out ol the state would be a
contradiction oi all history ¹! Nor is the iorce oi this argument in
any way weakened by the admitted lact that the principa] dispositione
known to early Roman law were effected under state supervision
(p.18,supr.). The object of this was to obtain a public guarantee
lor the rights which they conferred3 a citizen who disputed such
rights would be resisting the authority of the whole people. And it
is conceivable that the idea oi law backed by irresistible force, with
which Austin has made us familiar, and which is peculiar to societies
in which the judicature ¹is and has long been organized on an effective
system, was developed out ol this expedient ol desending individual
rights, through the medium oi a form, by the collective force ol the
whole community: ‘das Concrete war hier wie so oit in der Ges·
chichte des romischen Rechts die Brtlclre zum Abstracten ; aus dem
Schutz der Rechte entwickelte sich der Schutz des Rechts?

Lilre so many other irresponsible rulers, the ‘decemviri legibus
scribundis' were corrupted by the taste of power which they had
enjoyed; so much did they relish it that they attetppted to maire their
own office permanent, and to revolutionise the form ol government
by substituting themselves entirely lor the consuls and tribunes. Pre-
tending to make an ‘exaequatio iuris’ the main object ol their policy,
they set to work to attain it by reactionary measures; they were lor
retaining the comitia ornata only sor religious purposes, and lor
abolishing the comitia tributa altogether3 thus the plebeiam, would
lose their organisation, and so their very existence as an order, while
the privileges oi the patricians would be perpetuated, though under
forms slightly altered or disguised. The plebs saw through the
design, and (ac. 449) resorted once again to the well-tried stratagem
oi a secession. The patrician opposition at once crumbled to no-
thing, and the old constitution, with its consuls and tribunes, was
restored. By a lex ol the consuls, Horatius and Valerius (nc. 449), it
was enacted ‘ut quod tributim plebs iussisset populum teneret;' words
which must not be understood to mean that the comitia tributa
thereby received a legislative authority co-ordinate and coextensive
