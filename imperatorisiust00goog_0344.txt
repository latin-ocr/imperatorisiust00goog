INTRODUCTION TO BOOK III. · 331

tutes were published, the three distinct bodies oi rules relating to one
subject still coexisted side by side: the successoros an intestate might
base his claim on the Twelve Tables, on the Edict, or on some enact·
ment of the later civil law ς in the second case, it is true, he was not
technically heres, but, as we have already seen, his rights were sub·
stantially identical with those oia civil law successor. Cases were
even still to be found, in which agnatic relationship entitled a claimant
to priority over others who, ir cognation alone were considered, would
at least take with him pari passu. It was not unnatural that Justinian
should be dissatisfied with his work, and bya Novel issued in the year
a. n. 543 he substituted sor the system oi succession which has here
been sketched a new scheme based entirely· upon blood relatiouship,
oi which an account is given in the notes to Title 9. 9.

Two other modes ‘quibus res per universitatem adquiruntur,'
though ol lar less interest and importance than inheritance, are
described in Titles ιο and rr. The first ol these is the type ol adop·
tion known as adrogation. When a person sui iuris gave himself in
adoption to another, his universitas iuris passed, under the law as
previously settled, to the latter; bnt the development oi the filius·
familias' proprietary capacity had iniringed upon the necessity of this
rule, and Justinian, as he himself remarks, limited the adrogator's
right in accordance with the principle which he had already estab-
lished in the second book. The liability ol the adrogator lor debts
contracted by the adopted son while sni iuris is treated in the last
paragraph of the Title. The last remaining sorm ol universal succes·
aion, which was introduced by a constitution ol lllarcus Aurelius, was
aprovision ‘lavore libertatis,' to secure the lreedom ol slaves who
had been manumitted in a will under which no heres accepted, and
enabled any one who would give the creditors lull security lor the
satisfaction ol their claims to have the estate adjudged to him, thus
putting it in his power, as quasi heir, to iulfil the intentione ol the
deceased.

Title ra brielly touches on two universal successions obsolete under
Justinian’s legislati0n; the one the peculiar form ol bankruptcy execu-
tion known as bonorum emptio -a subject which is more fully
discussed in a note on the text; the other introduced by the SC.
Claudianum, ol which we have already read, and which, with its con·
sequences, was repealed by Justinian in person.

From this subject we pass at Title r 3 to the consideration ol the
important class ol res incorporales called obligations. An obligation
is a legal relation between two ascertained persons, in virtue ol which
