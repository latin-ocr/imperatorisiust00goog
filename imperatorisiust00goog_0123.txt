110 INSTITUTIONUM LIBRI QUATTUOR. [Lini.

V1.

QUI EX QUIBUS CAUSIS MANUMITTERE NON POSSUNT.

Non tamen cuicumque volenti manumittere licet. nam is
quiin fraudem creditorum manumittit nihil agit, quia lex
lAelia Sentia impedit libertatem. Licet autem domino, qui
solvendo non est, testamento servum⁴¹ suum cum libertate
heredem instituere, ut fiat liber heresque ei solus et neces·

sarius, si modo nemo alius ex eo testamento heres extiterit,
aut quia nemo heres scriptus sit, aut quia isqui scriptus est
qualibet ex causa heres non extiterit, idque eadem lege
Aelia Sentia provisum est et recte: valde enim prospiciendum
erat, ut egentes homines, quibus alius heres extaturus non
esset, vel servum suunt necessarium heredem habeant, qui
satisfacturus esset creditoribus, aut hoc eo non faciente credi·

sorbade them to live within one hundred miles os Rome under penalty
of becoming slaves again without possibility of a subsequent manumis-
sion ; 3ηά their property on decease went to their patron, Gaius iii. 74-
76. This dediticia libertas was practically obsolete before Justinian
(‘ nec in usu esse reperimus’Cod. 7. 5), and was lonnallyabolisbed by him,
as is stated in this section. (2) It placed restrictions on manumissions
by masters less than twenty years of age, Tit. 6. 4 inl. ; aad also (3) pro·
vided that no slave under thirty years ol age should be enfrancbised
so as to become a civis libertus unless the manumission vere by vin·
dicta, 3ηά an adequate motive were proved before a council at Rome,
and in the provinces before a body ol twenty recuperatores ; Gaius
i. 18-20. This provision was repealed by Justinian 3 see this paragraph,
ad fin. (4) lt invalidated manumissions in haud· ol creditors ; see Tit.6
pr. ins.

lt was said above that a Latinus could in certain ways become a
civis ; there were also modes in which alibertus could become ingenuus,
one ol which, operative only under the old law, has been noticed in the
note on ᾗ 1 supr. Ingenuitas, however, could be conferred by imperial
grant (‘ natalibus restitui' Dig. 40. 11. 2); and by the acquisition from
the emperor ol the ‘ius aureorum anulorum’ a t'reedman became in-
genuus during his lifetime‚ but could not prejudice his patron's rights
os succession; Dig. 38. 2. 3. pr, fragm. Vat. 226, Dig. 40. ιο. 6. By
Nov. 78. 1 and 2 Justinian bestowed the ius anulorum nn all freed·
men and freedwomen whatsoever: ‘si quis manumittens servum aut
ancillam suam . . . qui libertatem acceperit, habebit et aureorum anu-
lorum et regenerationis ius' .

nte. VI. For the term ‘heres necessarius,’ and the purpose os insti- ·
tuting one's own slave, see Bk. ii. 19. 1 inf.
