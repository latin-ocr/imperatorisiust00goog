Tit. 9.] SI QUADRUPES ΡΑ UPERIEM FECISSE DICI T UR. 565

Ceterum sciendum est aedilicio edicto prohiberi nos canem 1
verrem aprum ursum leonem ibi habere, qua vulgo iter fit:
et si adversus ea lactum erit et nocitum homini libero esse
dicetur, quod bonum et aequum iudici videtur, 'tanti dominus
condemnetur, ceterarum rerum, quanti damnum da'tum sit,
dupli. praeter has autem aedilicias actiones et de pauperie

extended ε ‘haec actio utilis competit, si non quadrupes sed aliud animal
pauperiem lecit' Dig. ib.4 lf the damage was done under provocation,
the noxal action did not lie, but the person who was its indirect cause
was liable: ‘et generaliter haec actio locum habet, quotiens contra
naturam fera mota pauperiem dedit Ideoque si equus dolore concitatus
calce petierit, cessare istam actionem, sed eum, qui equum percusserit
aut vulneraverit, in lactum . . . teneri: at si curn equum permulsisset quis
vel palpatus esset, calce eum percusserit, erit actioni locus’ Dig. ib. 7.
Damage done by an animal which sen within the rule was treated exactly
lilre a delict committed bya slave: ‘et cum etiam in quadrupedibus noxa
. caput sequitur, adversus dominum haec actio datur, non cuius fuerit
quadrupes, cum noceret, sed cuius nunc est. Plane si ante litem con-
testatam decesserit animal, extincta erit actio' Dig. ib. 12 and 13. So
too if the animal died naturally or by accident, the owners liability was
extinguished, Dig. ib. 16.

The illustration ol the bear might lead one to suppose that no noxal
action lay where the animal which did the damage was ferae naturae But
this assumption is contradicted in the text below (i 1 ‘praeter has autem
aedilicias actiones et de pauperie locum habet'); and though many are
lor rejecting this as bad law, it seems better tu say that the actio de
pauperie was available at any rate in the caseos an animal which, though
by birth ferae naturae, no longer enjoyed its natural liberty, but was in
some degree tamed or domesticated, and so in doing injury might be said
to be acting ‘against its nature!

The only case in which the owner oi a domestic beast was liable lor
damage done secundum naturam suani was where grazing animals strayed
and pastured on another's land (when an action lay under the Twelve
Tables), or fed on mast which fell on their owner’s land from a neigh-
bour's trees : ‘si glans ex arbore tua in meum fundum cadat, eamque ego
immisso pecore depascam, Aristo scribit, non sibi occurrere legitimam
actionem, qua experiri possisnam neque ex lege duodecim tabularum de
pastu pecoris, quia non in tuo pascitur, neque de pauperie, neque damni
iniuriae agi posse: in lactum itaque erit agendum’ Dig. 19. 5. 14 3.

ξ L The public roads were under the special charge os the aediles, Dig.
43. 10. The penalty prescribed in the edict lor the death oi a {reeman
was 200 solidi ; sor injury other than death a sum which was left to the
discretion ol the judge ; lor all other damage duplum. The action under
this edict seems to have been popularis.

Two or more actions are said to concur when one and the samo
