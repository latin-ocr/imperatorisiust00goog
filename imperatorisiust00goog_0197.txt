§2 Res publicae seem to be divisible into two classes, (1) Things
which belong to andare used by the state as by a private person: eg.
public slaves, money, stores, etc: these are not properly extra patri-
monium nostrum. (2) Things which are publico usui destinatae, (ie.
not communes generally, but only to cives), e. g. roads, harbours, public
rivers (ie. ‘flumina perennia' Dig. aa 12. 3) and their beds. The banks
of public rivers were private property, subjected by the law to a kind of
servitude in favour os all members ol the state, ξ 4 ins.

ξ 6. Universitas here seems to be used as equivalent to civitas, i.e. a
Roman city or municipium. Taken in this sense, res universitatis are
analogous to res publicae, and are divisible in the same manner. Such
property only of a provincial city as is municipum usui destinatum is
extra patrimonium: a res publica is a thing which any civis may use:
a res universitatis is one which may be used as of right ouly by the
members of the universitas.

Taken in its widest sense, universitas is equivalent to the ‘juristic
person’ ol modern writers. For the defiuition and characteristics of
juristic persons in general reference may be made to Holland's Juris-
prudence p. ²²5 sq.: those recoguised by Roman law may be sub-
divided into universitates personarum and universitates bonorum [The
latter should not be consounded with so-ealled universitates rerum (dis-
tantium), such as a flock of sheep, which have no independent legal
existence apart from the elements which go to make them up]

Α universitas personarum (or corporation) is an aggregate of natural
persons forming an ideal whole, regarded by the law as a ‘person ’ distinct
from its members lor the time being, because its existence does not
cease along with theirS, and invested with rights and subject to duties,
other than those ol the individuals, taken singly, ol which it is com·
