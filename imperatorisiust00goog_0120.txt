number. (1) VindIcta, a form of the praetor's voluntary jurisdiction, or
prearranged suit at law: the slave was claimed as free in a real action
(vindicatio) by au adsertor libertatis: the master, as defendant, in·
stead of resisting the claim by laying the vindicta or rod on the slave
before the praetor, released him (manu mittebat), thereby confessing
himself in the wrong, whereupon the praetor adjudged the slave free
(Plautus, mil. glor. 4. 1. 15). The procedure, which at first was strictly
that of the ‘legis actio sacramenti’ (for which see Gaius iv. 16, and
Index, inf.) was simplified in course of time by the part of adsertor being
played by one of the praetors lictors, and by the release of the master
from all formal cooperation: finally, the necessity of an adsertor was
altogether dispensed with, and it was held sufficientis the master, ac-
companied hythe slave, declared his intention of enfranchising him to
the praetor, whenever (‘ semper' ia the text is explained by Tmophilus
‘mi ἐν ἀπράκτῳ r‘ypqu') and wherever be met the latter, and if the latter
thereon formally adjudged him free: see ξ 2 of this Title, and for the
process generally Poste's Gaius loc. cit. (2) Censu (for the census see
General lntrod. p. 20. supr.) The censor could make anyone a citizen
of Rome by entering his name on the census or official list, and this was
used for manumission by the masters taking his slave to the censor and
allowing him to make his ‘professio' before him without entering an
objection. Ulpian speaks of the census as a thing of the past, only
three having been held since the Christian era, the last Α. 1). 74 ; the form
was revived but once afterwards, Α. 1). 249, so that Justinian does not
mention this as one of the modes in which a slave could gain his
freedom. (3) Testamento. The master could either bequeath a slave
his liberty directly‚ in which case he became ‘libertus orcinus,’ Bk. ii. 24·
2 inf, and was free from the moment the heir accepted the inheritance,
unless the manumission was conditional or ex die (note on Tit. 20.1inf.),
or imposed on the heir (or some other person) an obligation to manumit
him (libertas fideicommissario), in which case he became the freedman
of the person by whom he was manumitted ; cf. Ulpian, reg. 2. 7. 8.
These were in Cicero’s time the only modes in which a manumitted
slave could become liber. lf the master attempted to enfranchise him
in any other way (eg. by a declaration in the presence of witnesses—
‘manumissio iuter amicos¹ Ulpian, reg. 1. 18, Pliny, Ep. 7. 16, Seneca
de vit. beat. 24 2 -by a letter, ‘per epistolam,' Martial, ep. 9. 89, Isi-
dorus, orig. 9. 4, or by treating him as free, e. g. convivii adhibitione, by
invitiug him to sit at meat with him-which were called manumissiones
minus solennes), the man remained legally a slave, but was said ‘in
libertate esse' Gaius iii. 56, note on Tit. 3. 5 supr. Α legal status was Ι
first conferred on slaves manumitted in any of these inforrnal ways by
the lex lunia Norbana, n. n. 19, for which see ou t 3 inf. Α new form of
