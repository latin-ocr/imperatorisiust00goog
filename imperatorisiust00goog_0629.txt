personalarrest anddetention seems abnormal. Fromthispoint,however‚
we find awell marked divergence. One alternative ‘consists in toler-
ating distraint up to a certain point: it is counived at so lar as it

serves to compel the submission ol defendants to the jurisdiction ot'
courts, but in all other cases it is treated as awillul breach ol the
peace. The other is the incorporation ol distraint with a regular
procedure. The complainant must observe a great number of forms
at his peril, but il he observes them he can distrain in the end ¹.’ The
first step, we may say, in the process by which seli-redress slowly
yielded to the encroachments ol courts ol justice was the gradual
development ol a body ol custom, in some cases extremely bully,
precisely detining the conditione under which it might be exacted‚
and minutely prescribing the proper stages in the process, without the
due observance ol which the complainant 'must altogether lose his
remedy. Notice ol the intention to distrain—lasting upon the wrong-
⁶ doct-attendance ol witnesses—allowance ol a ‘stay' or interval
between the earlier and later steps-and many other lormalities are,
or may be, the essential conditione ol success. Such limitation by
custom ol the right ol sell·redress-in other words, its ‘incorporation
with a regular procedure '-is most common irr societies, such as that
ol the Irish as revealed to us in the Brehon law tracts, in which, even
il there be a judicial system at all, its action is wealr and intermittent,
or where ‘courts of justice exist less lor the purpose of doing right
universally than lor the purpose ol supplying an alternative to the
violent redress ol wrong! But ‘the Roman tribunals became the
organs ol the national sowereignty at an exceptionally early date,
and the development ol Roman law and procedure was exceptionally
rapid ;' consequently, we are enabled to bridge over the gulf between
the primitive system ol private vengeance‚ and the earliest Roman
civil process of which we have any knowledge, less by tracing this
gradual incorporation ol seli-redress with a regular procedure than
by other indications ol more advanced ideas. These in the main are
three in number: the introduction and development ol the idea of
composition sor injury; the plan ol guaranteeing a man’s rights by
collective action through witnesses; and the contractual decision ol
disputes

i. There can be little doubt that the term ‘poena' originally meant
not so much penalty as composition lor injury; the earliest poenae
were sums in consideration ol which the injured person consented to
lorego 'his customary right ol sels-redress, and the penal sums re-
