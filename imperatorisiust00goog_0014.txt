GENERAL INTRODUCTION.

Tur purpose of this Introduction is to give as full an account asia
practicabte, in a work such as this edition of the Institutes, of the
history oi Roman Law and Legislation. In order to allow the largest
possible amount of space to strictly legal topics, constitutional history
has been avoided, except so sar as it seemed that these could not
be adequately understood without occasionally touching upon it. Itis
of course impossible to write on the history oi any legislation without
taking some notice of the persons or bodies by whom legislative sunc-
tione are or have been exercised3 but such digressions from purely legal
matters can fortunately he confined within tolerably narrow limita,
because the Roman system owed so large a part of its development
in point oi matter to the praetor, whose powers, so iar as they were
legislative, were exercised indirectly, and it may almost be said covertly‚
and in point of form to the jurists, whose constitutional position,
despite their direct influence on law, was in reality quite unimportant.

So iar as legislation goes, what will here be said is little more than
a commentam, written in historical sequence, on the seven sources oi
law from which the Roman system is said (Inst. i. a. 3) to be derived.
Aa regards the system itsels, apart from the agencies by which it was
directly developed, or viewed lrom within rather than from without,
the principal topics which will be treated are the relation of public and
private law at Rome; the influence of caste, or, more precisely, oi the
patriciam and plebeiam elements respectively on the material character
of the system3 the ⁸ duplication os institutions‘ which resulted irom·
the coexistence of what we may perhaps call a purely national with
a cosmopolitan legislative organ; the gradual absorption by what was
cosmopolitan oi what was purely national; and the development and
character oi the Roman scientific or philosophical jurisprudence
