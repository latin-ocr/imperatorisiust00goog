enables one to inser to which ol the two empires they more properly
belong.

Certain compilations ol Roman law made by the Germane who
swept away the Westem empire deserve a passing notice. (r) Among
the Ostrogoths‚ whose king Theodoric (a n. 475-526) conquered Italy
in an. 493, and ruled it as representative ol the emperor at Constan-
tinople, the Roman and German systems did not, as elsewhere, stand
in opposition to one another, but the Gothic invaders resigned their
own law and submitted themselves to that ol Rome. The ‘Edictum
Theodorici’ is a collection os the most practically important rules ol
Roman law arranged in statute lorm lor the purpose ol enabling the
countrymen ol Theodoric to know the law under which they lived,
and is based on the imperial constitutions and the sententiae and re·
sponsa ol Paulus. Among the Visigoths and Burgundians, on the
other hand, the original subjecta ol the empire retained their own
jurisprudence, to which their conquerors declined to submit themselves.
Thus (a) the codex Alaricianus (or breviarium) was a kind os Digest
ol the law observed by the Roman subJects ol the Visigoth king
Alaric ll (an. 484-507)‚ comprhing, besides imperial constitutions
very large portions ol the commentaries ol Gaius, and excerpts from
the sententiae ol Paulus and Papinian's liber I responsomm. (3) A
compilation ol Roman law lor the Roman subjects ol the Burgundian
empire was made by order ol king Sigismund about 5¹7 nn. ; it is
usually termed ‘Papian' (abbreviated from Papinian, because it is said
to have commenced with that jurist's liber l responsorum), and con·
taius lorty·seven Tities, part ol which are taken from the code ol
Alaric.

Justinian, who was ol Sclav descent, was at the age ol lorty-srve
(a n. 527) raised by his uncle Justinus to the position ol joint ruler ol
the Eastem Empire, and in the same year, by the death ol his partner,
he became sole emperor. In the interval ol somewhat less than a
century which had elapsed since the legal relorms ol Theodosius and
Valentinian‚ a process os divergence had been constantly going on
between the laws laid down in the code ol Theodosius and the ‘law
ol Citations,' and the law as actually applied in the tribunals. This
was principally due to the small number ol copies which existed ol the
authorized enactments and juristic literature: ‘Homines etenim, qui
antea lites agebant, licet multae leges fuerant positae, tamen ex paucis
lites praeferebant, vel propter inopiam librorum, quos comparare eis
impossibile erat, vel propter ipsam inscientiam, et voluntate iudicum
magis quam legitima auctoritate lites dirimebantur' (Justinian in Cod
