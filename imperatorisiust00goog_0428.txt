accipi, ut, quodcumque seriptum sit quasi aetum, videatur χ
etiam actum: ideoque constat, si quis se scripserit fideiussisse,
videri omnia sollemniter acta.

Besides fideiussio, which was a formal contract, the Roman law of
Justinian recognised two other modes in which the relation of suretyship
could be produced: the one a consensual contract (the socalled manda-
tum qualificatum, for which see Tit. 26. 5 and notes, inf), the other a
mere pact, viz. constitutum debiti alieni.

Constitutum is a formless promise to discharge an already subsisting
obligation, whether it be oue’s own (const. debiti sui) or some one’s else
(const. debiti alieni) ; ΒΚ iv. 6. 9. inf. ln itself it did not belong to any
recognised class of contracts, and therefore did not give rise to a civil
obligation : it was made actionable by the praetor, because, according to
Theophilus, the want of a remedy on this class of promises led not only
to fraud but to great hardship: see Hunter's Roman Law p. 386. Usually
the promise was to pay on a day certain; but if this was not so, the
promisor was entitled to ten days' grace, Dig. ¹3· 5. 21. 1.

Constitutum debiti alieni resembles fideiussio in presupposing an actual
even though only ‘natural’ liability of another person, Dig. 13. 5. 1.1;
i. 6-8; in the right of two or more constituentes to the beneficium divi-
sionis, Cod. 4 18. 3: in the surety's right to the beneficium ordinis, N ov.
4 1 (at any rate in those cases where his obligation is exactly coextensive
with that of the principal debtor, and its object is merely the creditor's
security), and as a rule to use such exceptiones of the principa} debtor as
practically, though not formally, annihilate the creditor's right against
him. But while the fideiussor is in effect a correus, and the sole end of his
liability is the creditor's security, constitutum was often designed to con·
fer on the latter further advantages: the obligation was different from
that of the principa} debtor, and solidary rather than correal. Hence the
constituens is not prejudiced hythe latter's culpa or mora: but, like
solidary debtors in general, he is not necessarily released by extinction of
the main debt, but only by satisfaction of the creditor, so that (e g.) he
remains liable after the action against the debtor is barred by lapse of
time (Dig. 13. 5. 18. 1), or even after the latter has paid one of two
correal creditors, with the other of whom he himself made the consti·
tutum, Dig. ib. 1ο. In respect of time and place of performance he may
be bound differently, and even in duriorem causam than the main
debtor, ib. 3. 2. Before Justinian a constitutum could be made in
relation only to res fungibiles, and the action on it was prescribed in
a year; both of these limitations he abolished, and also theold penal
wager in the action of half the value in dispute (Gaius iv. 171), Cod. 4.
18.1; so that under his system a constituens might be bound for
a different object of equal value with that for which the principal debtor
was liable, Cod ib. 1. 5 ; if it was of greater value, he was not answerable
for the excess, ib. 11. 1.

One of the salient features of the Roman law of suretyship is the
