it, was naturally not backward in calling his master’s attention to this
imperfectiora. Justinian, therefore, in an. 534, appointed a new corn-
mission, consisting ol Tribonian, as president, and four others, to revise
the Code oi au. 529. Within a iew months the latter, and also the
constitutions issued alter its enactment, were deprived ol all authority,
and withdrawn from circulation, their place being talren by a new Code,
known as the ‘codex repetitae praelectionis,’ in which were incor-
porated Justinian's own constitutions, as wel as many others which
the earlier Code had not contained: some again which had stood in
the latter were now omitted, and there were numerous alterations and
interpolations, Tribonian sparing no pains to malte the revision as
complete as possible. The codex repetitae praelectionis was promul·
gated on Nov. 16, 534, with statutory force from the ensuing 29th os
December. It consisted of twelve books, and in arrangement followed
very closely the order oi the Digest

The adversaries oi codification have made great capital out of an
error into which its advocates have sometimes fallen, and which eon·
sists in supposing that a good Code dispenses with the necessity ol
any lurther legislation; they have even accused Justinian of believing
thatin his three great bodies ol law was summed up the perlection
ol human wisdom, and that they would suffice, without addition or
alteration, to determine forali time the rights and duties oi his sub
jects. Itis quite certain that Justinian never believed anything oi the
ltind. His main purpose had been to set the law upon a solid soun-
dation, and to cast it in a form which his successors would not lightly
venture to alter; by the completeness oi his worlr he hoped to endow
his subjects with the inestimable hlessing ol a legal system pruned ol
all relies ol antiquity, adequate in substance, and so judicibusly ar·
ranged as to reduce the necessity ol sutore change to a minimum.
But within five years to have entirely recast a large portion oi his own
worlt might well arouse the suspicion, that the law had lost all its old
stability; that the legislature had become too active; that as the first
Code had been thrust aside to make room lor a second, so the second
would soon be swept away in favour of a third, and that in the consu·
sion which such constant change could not fail to produce the many·

sided security which all law is intended to guarantee would cease to
exist. In his publication os the codex repetitae praelectionis Justinian
deemed it necessary to disarm all sear ol such atendency. He ex·
. pressly recognised the probability, if not the necessity, oi subsequent
change, and enacted that constitutions issued alter the publication oi
the Code should be formed into a distinct collection, under the title oi
