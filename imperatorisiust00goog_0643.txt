Personal actions on delict which were not penal, but reparatory (e. g.
condictio furtiva) claimed an incertum, and had a peculiar intentio
(e. g. si paret A. A : N. N. pro lure damnum decidere oportere). These
three lorms of intentio in personal actions—dare, dare facere, and pro
damno decidere—correspond to the common Roman division oi
obligations according as they consist in dando, faciendo, or praestando r
and the two first, when standing alone, without the addition ‘ex fide
bona' to be shortly noticed‚ are characteristic oi the action known in ⁰
the formulary system as condictio. Condictio is either certi, tritican'a,
or incerti. (1)Condictio certi corresponds to the old legis actio
introduced by the lex Silia3 it is the appropriate action ior the re·
covery os certa pecunia, and its intentio mns ‘ si paret A. A. r N. N.
x milia sestertium dare oportere! (a) Condictio triticaria corresponds
to the legis actio as extended by the lex Calpurnia, and lies sor the
recoveryol certa res : its intentio runs ‘si paret A. A. r Ν. N. fundum,
hominem, tritici x modios dare oportere! (3) Condictio incerti is the
remedy where the obligation is to perform some personal act other
than a conveyance, and is usually brought upon a stipulation; hence
its more common nemeis actio ex stipulatu; the form ol the intentio
is ‘quicquid dare lacere .. . oportet!

iii. condictiones are called stricti iuris iudicia Contrasted with
them is another class ol actions in personam, descended from iudicis
arbitrive postulatio, and called sometimes arbitria, but more properly
bonae fidei iudicia ¹. They are enumerated in Gaius iv. 62, Bk. iv.
6. 28 supr„ the commonest ol them being the actions on contracts iuris
gentium exclusive os mutuum. The name is derived from the addition
ol the words ‘ ex fide bona’ in the Intentio (e. g. quicquid ob eam rem
A. A. : N. N. ex fide bona dare lacere oportet), which indicate that
the plaintill's demand is oi something more ‘incertum' even than
inecondictio incerti; its value is to be ascertained only by a careiul
balancing and adjustment ol conflicting claims, and consequently the
judge is here allowed alar greater latitude of discretiori ; the procedure
is that os equity rather than ol law ¹. ¹

iv. Another division os actions based upon structural difference ol
Intentio is that into actio directa and actio utilis, which grew out ol
the practice os extending an action to cases which did not come within

¹ The te'rm arbitrium in Roman law, in the sense oi an action. means either an
actio arbitraria, p. 545 supr„ or a bonae fidei iudicium and the person who tn'es
an action oi either os these classes is called arbiter as osten as iudex.

fidei iudicia aee on Bk. iv. 6. 28 supr.
