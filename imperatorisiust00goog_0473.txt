EXCURSUS 'V.

THE GENERAL NATURE OF OBLIGATIONS.

Tim term obligatio properly indicates a legal relation between two
definite persons, whereby the one (creditor, Dig. 50. 1⁶. rr, and ra.
pr.) is entitled to a certain actor forbearance on the part oi the
other (debitor). The contrast between it and the relation existing
in the case of ownership, possession, or other legal rights, is well
marked by Paulus in Dig. 44. 7. 3. pr. ‘obligationum substantia non
in eo consistit, ut aliquod corpus nostrum, aut servitutem nostram
iaciat, sed ut alium nobis obstringat ad dandum aliquid, vel faciendum,
vel praestandum‚' with which may be compared Bk. iv. 6. ι inl.
‘namque agit unus quisque aut cum eo, qui ei obligatus est . . ·. quo
casu proditae sunt actiones in personam . . . aut cum eo agit qui nullo
iure ei obligatus est, movet tamen alicui de aliqua re controversiam,
quo casu proditae actiones in rem sunt.’ No better explanation of
this contrast can be found than Austin’s exposition of the difference
between rights in rem and rights in personam, the merit ol which,
however, is matred by his use ol the term obligation to denote the ,
duty corresponding to rights ol the former as well as ol the latter
class.

But though this is the proper and normal meaning of the term,
obligatio is sometimes used in other senses, and more especially to
express one or other limb oi the relation in contradistinction to the
other ; thus, it signifies the right os the creditor only in the common
phrase adquirere obligationem (Bk. iii. 28,Dig.45.1. 126. ις ²3· 3.
46: cl. Bk. ii. 2. a supa), and the duty of the debitor only in Dig. ιι.
ι. 36 ; 46. 1. 5. ιι, ib. g. 95. 3, as well as in the definition given in
Bk. iii. ¹3· pr. supr. Sometimes it denotes specifically the act or
event lrom which the relation arises, as in Cod. 11. 47. aa, Dig. a.
ιι. ι. 3, as well as in the expressions verborum obligatio, litterarum
obligatio, etc. Again‚ though onlya person can properly be ‘obli-
gatus' objects which are pledged are occasionally spoken ol by
analogy as subject to an obligation, eg. Bk. iii. 27· ι supr, Dig. 20.
