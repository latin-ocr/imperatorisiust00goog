law, honorariae or praetoriae if their source is the Edict oi the magis·
trote, ξ 3. Real praetorian actions are exemplified by the actiones
Publiciana, Serviana, and hypothecaria, ἕξ 4-73 among those which
are personal are the actiones de pecunia constituta (ξ 9), de peculio
(ξ ιο), and others which are penal ( η).

iii. Finally, there is a division the origin ol which is to be sought
in the formulary period, and which turns upon the nature os the pro·
cedure. Actiones arbitrariae (5 31) are those by which the plaintiff
obtains delivery or productiori ol specific property and specific per·
fonnance ol contract. Actions in personam are either stricti iuris
orbonae fidei (§ 28), a distinction more fully explained elsewhere¹;
the latter class is illustrated by examples, and the extension ol one of
its leading features—set oli-to the former is noticed in § 30.

Lastly, thrust into this classification ol actions, in delerence to
Gaius, are one or two topics which would have been better discussed
in some other place. The thirty-second section, which corres-
ponds with Gaius iv. 52, should properly form part ol Title 17 (⁴ de
officio indicis’); and the explanation ol the effecta of plus and minus
petitio, and oi erroneous as distinct lrom over claim (ξς 33-35, cor-¹
responding with Gaius iv. 53-60), which really is a matter ol Proce-
dnre, might be placed in several os the following Titles as appropri-
ately as here.

ln the seventh Title are explained the so called ‘actiones adiectitiae
qualitatis,’ by which the Praetor had tempered the inequitable doctrine
ol the civil law that a master or paterfamilias, though entitled to all
benefit under the contracts ol his slaves or children in power, could
in no case be sued upon them. By the actiones'quod iussu, exer-
citoria, and institoria the superior became liable in solidum whenever
it could be shown that he had directed or authoriaed the contract.
Where a slave or filiusfamilias embarlted a peculium in trade with his
master's or father's knowledge, and became insolvent, the master or
lather was permitted to distribute the assets among the creditors,
though any one ol them who was dissatisfied with such distribution
was e‘nabled by the actio tributoria to bring it under jndicial reviewr
il the pater or dominus was himsella creditor, he was entitled to no
larger dividend than the rest. where, on the other hand, the slave
or son made the contract without the superior’s knowledge, the latter
was liable in person by the actio de in rem verso so far as the trans·
action had resulted in a benefit to himself ; otherwise he could be
compelled only to surrender the peculium, and had the privilege of
