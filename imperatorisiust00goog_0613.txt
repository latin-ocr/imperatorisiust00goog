veteris calumniae actione introducta sunt, quae in desuetu-

quod nusquam sactum esse invenimus: sed pro his introductum

swear ‘non calumniae causa se ad inficias ire' only where he was not
restrained irotn vexatiously deiending the action by some other re·
cognised motive, such as the penal sponsio in condictio certi and the
actio de constituta pecunia, the duplication ol damages in some actions
on denial of liability, or the penal nature of the action itself, Gaius iv.
172. By Cod 2. 59.2 Justinian required thenath [rom all defendants
and their advocates.

By a delendant's ‘allegationes’ are to be understood the evidence and
arguments in support oi his contradictio, Cod. 3 1. 14. 1. The oath was
taken on the Bible‚ ‘sacrosanctae scripturae’ Cod. loc. cit. The primary
juristic signification ol ‘instantia’ seems to be ‘lreenness' ‘energy¹ (‘dili-
genti studio instantiaque complere opera’ Cod 8. 12. 22, ⁴ stricta instantia
’ salsum arguere paratus’ Cod. 9. 22. 24), whence it comes to mean, as
here, a contention (⁴ believing that his contentiori in defence is honest ¹).

For the actions in which it was said ‘adversus inficiantes lis crescit in
duplum' see on Bk. iii. 27. 7 supe: cf. Tit. 6.19and 26 supr. The
actions to which Justinian alludes, in which ‘adversus inficiantem lis
crescit in triplum,’ are unknown ; those on furtum conceptum and obla·
tum (p. 501 supr.) were in triplum ‘sive quis neget sive fateatur,’ and the
triple penalty in Tit. 6. 24 supr. did not apparently result from a denial
ol liability.

ln the earlier procedure vexatious litigation in plaintiffs had been
restraiued in four ways: ‘actoris quoque calumnia coercetur modo
calumniae iudicio, modo contrario, modo iureiurando, modo resti-
pulatione' Gaius iv. 174 ln actions where there was a sponsio poenalis,
the defendant could require that the plaintiff should promise him by
restipulatio an equivalent sum in the event ol his being unable to prove
his case. ln other suits, is absolved, he could often bring against
him an action in the nature of ‘malicious prosecution’ By the actio
calumniae he might recover ἡ (in interdicts llos the value in dispute
in the previous action, but had to prove that the other had sued him
knowing that he had no ground os action, ‘calumnia eninr in adfectu
est' Gaius iv. 178. By the contrarium iudicium, which was an alter·
native to this, but which lay only against an unsuccesssul plaintiff in
certain specific actions (e. g. iniuriae, Gaius iv. 177), and in which it was
unnecessary to prove malice, he could similarly recover damages
equivalent to some fraction oi the amount claimed in the previous
action. Neither of these iudicia, however, lay, nor could the defendant
claim a penal restipulatio, it he had compelled the plaintiff to take the
iusiurandum calumniae, i. e. to swenr that to the best of his belief he had
a good ground os action, Gaius iv. 181.

Under Justinian the penal sponsio and restipulatio in the two actions
