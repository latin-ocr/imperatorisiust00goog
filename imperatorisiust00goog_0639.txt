626 EXCURSUS X.

guards against errors of form which gave the legis actio its twaedged
character. Any such error, however trivial it might be, entailed com·
plete and irrevocable loss of action, for the maxim ‘nemo de eadem
re bis experiri potest' forbade the bringing of a second suit: aud yet
the chauces of such mistalte were so innumerable, the path of the
litigant was so beset with the pitfalls of formalism, that justice must
have been only too often defeated. Thus, in manus iniectio, and
pignoris capio, the proceedings took place to a large extentis not
entirely, out of court; and yet the dightest slip, even in an ignorant
creditor, brought upon him irremediable defeat In the succeeding
system, as is remarked by Mr. Poste ¹, no litigant could commit a
suicidal error before the final moment at which the suit was trans·
ferred from praetor to iudex. In the same note he calls attention to the
rigidity of statute-Process—its wantos power of expansion. The
forms of action were crystallised in the law, and incapable of multi·
plication; the right presnpposed the remedy, not the remedy the
right, the praetor himself had his hands tied, and was a mere piece
of machinery. Α new order of things was inaugurated by the lex
Aebutia, circ. 170 nc.

With a few reservations ¹, this statute abolished the legis actio pro·
cedure, though we do not know whether its action was exclusively
destructive. It is usual to speak of it as having ‘introduced' the
formulary system; but it is quite uncertain whether the outlines of
the latter were slretched in the statute, or whether it lest the praetor
to devise and apply a new procedure at his own discretion But,
whatever its source, the new system bas two leading features. One is
the universal division of every judicial proceeding or action into two
portions, one which toolr place before the praetor, in iure, and the
other which took place before the iudex, in iudicio. We have seen
the growing tendency towards this in the legis actio period. So long as

¹ ‘ihc cases in which statute-Process was allowed to survive were (1) those
which had to be tried in the decemviral and centumviral courts, where the pro·
cedure was by sacramentum (a)'damuum infectum (note on Blr. iii. 18. a supr),
where, according to Mr. Poste, ir was hy iudicis arbitrive postulatio, though Beth·
manu-Hollweg is more probably right in supposing it to have been a cese of pignoris

vindicta, and in iure cessio: see Keller, Civil Process 5 ²4· Gaius says (ir. 30)
that the two leges Iuliae (passed in the reign of Augustus) assisted in the over·
throw of statute-Preces. All that they seem to have done, however, was to
abolish the decemviri as an independent court, combining them in some way with
the centumviri, aud to limit the jurisdictiou of the latter. Puchta. Inst l 163, cf.
