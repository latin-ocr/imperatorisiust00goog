48 INTRODUCTION.

Under Augustus we first find traces oi a division oi the jurists into
two sects or schools. Their respective leaders, distinguished from

one another bya difference oi political no less than oi legal views,
were Antistius Labeo and C. Ateius Capito. Labeo had inherited from
his father Quintus a strong republican sentiment, and was in the habit
os lamenting the prevailing disrespect of the good old laws which
had never been constitutionally abrogated. At first an auditor ol
Trebatius, he attended the chambers ol all the prominent jurists ol his
day ; and the width os his studies liberalised his views on law, and
saved him lrom a lailing which was not uncommon among his con·
temporaries‚ a slavish devotion to the tenets of some particular
teacher. A man of varied culture and instrueted in lar more than one
department ol knowledge, his leading characteristics were a wide
intellectual range, a correct appreciation oi the place oi law in social
development and ol its relation to other sciences, a dislilre ol all
pedantry‚ a wealth of new views and principles, with which he was
ever ready to challenge and supersede the old. Sixtythree excerpts
[rom his writings are preserved in the Digest. Capito was more or less
os a novus homo, and asupporter ol the imperial rgr'nu, in which he
saw the best prospects oi his own advancement. It is related of him
that, with a salse show os independence, he opposed Tiberius when the
latter wished to stop the prosecutiones a man accused ol putting an
affront upon the imperial dignity. As ajurist, he was distinguished
by a devotion to the letter ol the law and the traditional treatment of
legal questions, and by atoo literal interpretation ol positive mles.
The opposition between the two was thus the opposition between
an absolute reliance on traditional principles and opinions supported
by approved authority, and a legal mind conscions ol its powers, oi
the living organic nature os law, ol the inevitableness of its growth
and expansion. It resulted in a number os legal controversias be-
tween Labeo and Capito, which they bequeathed to their successors;
thus originating the two schools whose disputes were ever widening
their range, and which termed their founders and leaders ‘nostri
praeceptores,' and those os their opponents ‘diversae scholae prae·
ceptores' respectively. The leading disciple of Capito was Mastrrius
Sabinus (Gaius ii. 218), from whom the school derived its name
‘Sabinian,' and who, as having given it a new direction, is to be
regarded as its proper founder. Capito had contented himself with a
passive resistance to Labeo's innovations; Sabinus and his followers
even went so sar as to adopt Labeo's tendency to develope new news,
but were carelul to disagree irom the other school whenever an
