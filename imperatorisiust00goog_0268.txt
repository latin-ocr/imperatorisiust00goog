Tit.14] DE HEREDIBUS INSTITUENDIS. 255

arbitrio adire hereditatem potest. Servus alienus post domini 2

mortem recte heres instituitur, quia et cum hereditariis servis
est testamenti factio: nondum enim adita hereditas personae
vicem sustinet, non heredis futuri, sed defuncti, cum et eius,

Here again there were exceptions on the ground ol age and absence
reipublicae causa.

(4) By the same statute, husband and wile who had no children by
the marriage could take under one another’s wills only a tenth ol what
was given them (lex decimaria), though the amount was increased by
the existence of issue by a previous marriage, or if such issue had died.
They were, however, entitled in addition to the usulruct of a third of the
residue from which they were excluded. Portions which under these
last two statutes could not be taken by those for whom they had been
intended, became caduca, and went in the first instance to co-legatees
with children, in the second, to instituted male heirs with children, in

, the third, to male legatees with children, and in delault os all, to the
treasury. Tbese restrictions, however, no longer existed under Jus-
tinian, the penalties os coelibatus and orbitas having been abolished by
the sons ot Constantine, Cod. 8. 16. 1, and the lex decimaria repealed
by Honorius and Theodosius, Cod. 8. 58. 2.

(5) Domitian disqualilied feminae probrosae from taking either the
hereditas or legata, Dig. ²9· 1. 41. 1, Cod. 5. r. 23. For other disabilities
imposed on persons who married a second time, or on illegitimate while
legitimare children were living, see Cod. 5. 9. 6and 10, Nov. 22. 27 and 28,
Nov. Bp 12, sor a different case, Tit. 17. 8 inl. F inally, the hereditas
or legata were sometimes ‘erepta’ from the person prima facie entitled
on the ground of unworthiness (see Dig. 34. 9, Cod. 6. 35), the forfeiture
being sometimes in favour of the fiscus, sometimes in that of other
persons.

For the institutiones servus proprius sine libertate see Gaius ii. 186,
Ble 1. 6. 2 supr, Cod. 6. 27. 5.

92. ibe opening words ol this paragraph are ambiguous; they may
refer to· the institution oia slave actually at the time belonging to a
hereditas iacens (Dig. 28. 5. 52, ib. 64), or to an institution not to take
effect until the dominus ol the slave instituted is dead, Theoph.

The institution ol a servus alienus is at first sight enigmatical, sor as
he could acquire the inheritance only lor his master, why not institute
the latter at once? The solution is twofold. Firstly, the institution ol
the slave secured the transmission of the inheritance to the heirs ol his
master, whereas il the latter ¹had been instituted himself and had pre·
deceased the testator, the institution would have lapsed: and this could
not be prevented by giving a ‘remainder' to his heirs hy substitution, for
they were incertae personae; nemo est heres viventis. To guard against
the contingency ol the slave's own death in the liletime ol the testator,
several slaves might be instituted by way of substitution. The other
advantage ol instituting a servus alienus will appear from a considera-
