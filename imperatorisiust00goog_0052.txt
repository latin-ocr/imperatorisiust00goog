the peculiarities ol the civil law—formality, exclusiveness, rigidity; they
are liberal, equitable, fitted to endure through all time; and these are
based upon the ius gentium, or rather upon the natural sense ol right,
the naturalis aequitas, in which the Romans recognised that law's
internal and generative principle. The ius gentium and the ius hono-
rarium or praetorium (lor practical purposes the expressions are
nearly synonymous) thus require to be distinguished, and their relation
to one another ascertained. The distinction ol ius civile and ius
honorarium is based on the difference ol the organs to whose activity
they respectively owed their existence ; that oi ius civile and ius gen-
tium on differences ol nature and oi extension The two would have
corresponded exactly il the whole ius gentium had been taken up into
the urban edict, and the latter had contained no other law whatsoever3
but as a matter ol lact, though there is a very intimate relation between
them, rules could and did belong to the one without also belonging to
tbe other. Still, the most important portion of the rules enunciated
in the edict can be traced to the ius gentium, which indeed was the
element in it which gave it such an honourable prominence among the
sources ol the positive law os Rome. Hence the common opposition,
to which attention hasbeen already drawn, between the ius praeto·
rium and the ius civile. Yet not unirequently the lormer is rechoned
part ol the latter, or rather the edicta magistratuum are enumerated
among its sources (e. g. Cic. Top. 5), though it is lar more usual to
find thern contrasted (as in Dig. 28. 1. ²3 ‘testamentum utroque
iure valebit, tam civili quam praetorio ’). The contrast was in part a
material one, the civil law was ‘proprium civitatis nostrae,’ whereas
the greater part of the ius praetorium was derived from the ius gen·
tium, and therefore its validity extended itseli beyond the limits ol the
Roman state into all nations which were under the rule ol law. But
in part, as has been remarlred above, it arose lrom the difference ol'
the organs through which the civil and the praetorian law respectively
came into existence. hrule ol the ius praetorium had no validity
other than that which could be given it by the praetor by whom it
was issued 3 it did not bind his successors or even his official col-
leagues3 its force was sar less, both in duration and in universality‚
than that ol a lex enacted by the sovereign populus. Rights conierred
in the latter way were necessarily protected by the praetor at all times,
but they existed apart from and independently ol him; rights con-
lerred by the edict depended purely and simply on his good laith;
thus (Dig. 7. 4. r) ‘usus fructus iure constitutus’ is opposed to ‘usus
imctus tuitione praetoris constitutus ;’ and it was through this ionually
