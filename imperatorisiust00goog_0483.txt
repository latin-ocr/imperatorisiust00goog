Instances in which this highest degree of diligence was demanded are
those of the commodandus, Bk. iii. ¹4· 2; the depositor, the pledgee
in a pignus, ib. 43 the vendor, Dig. 18. 6. 3; the hirer (conductor),
Dig. 19. 2. 57, and letter (locator), Cod. 4. 6. 282 the authorized
agent (mandatarius), Cod. 4. 35. 2 3, and unauthorized agent (negoti-
orum gestor), Blr. iii. 27. 2.

(2) In other relations the law was satisfied with aless rigid standard:
i.e. a man was lequired to be only as careful as he was in affairs
which concernedno one but himself, or in which he himself would be
the person primarily injured by carelessness: ‘talem praestare dili·
gentiam qualem in suis rebus adhibere solet ;' or, as modern writers
say, he was held answerable only for culpa levis in concreto. This
lower degree of carefulness only was demanded from the depositary
(Dig. 26. 3. 322 the contradiction of Bk. iii. ¹4· 3 is only apparent):
the lender (commodator), Dig. 47. 2. 63. 6; the tutor, Dig. 27. 3. 2.
pr. and curator; partners (socii) inter se, Dig. 27. 2. 52. 22 16. 72 ;
22122122 and colegatees‚ Dig. 22. a: 2 5. 26, and the husband 12 respect
of the dos, Dig. 23. 3. 27. If one may lay down a general rule, it
would perhaps best be formulated thus: in contractual and quasi-
contractual relations the defendant is usually required to show exacta
diligentia, but the burden of proving his negligence is on the plaintiff3
in some of them, however, the defendant is excused if he can prove that
he has shown such diligence and care as 122 usually displays in the

. conduct ol his own affairs.

lllr. Poste, in his note 22 this subject (Gaius pp. 478-481), criti·
21222 22 unnecessary and complicated the tripartite division into the
diligence (2) 21 an ordinary man, (6) 21 2 man in his own concernS,
and (c) of the bonus paterfamilias, and adopts the two last criteria
only. The result of this is a faulty determination of culpa lata, which
he defines as ‘the absence of the degree of diligence which a marr habi·
tually bestows on his own concerns ;’ that this is wrong is clear from
the definition cited above from Dig. 50. 16. 213. 2. Hence too arises a
practical difficulty: for il we suppose (2. g.) a partner to be less careful
in suis rebus than an ordinary man, and yet to display in societatis
rebus that care which he bestows on his own, how is he to be judged?
He has been guilty of culpa lata according to the definition of the
Digest, and yet 22 Mr. Poste’s principle he is not ansverable.

No test has yet been suggested for determining the degree of dili·
gence required by law in a given relation which is not marred by per-
plexing exceptions. Perhaps the one which covers the greatest number
of instances is that proposed by Mr. Poste, p. 479: ‘the principle
