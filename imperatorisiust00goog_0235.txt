autem duo genera shnt: mortis causa et non mortis causa.

l Mortis causa donatio est, quae propter mortis fit suspicionem,
cum quis ita donat, ut, si quid humanitus ei contigisset,
haberet is qui accepit: sin autern supervixisset qui donavit,
reciperet, vel si eum donationis poenituisset aut prior deces-
serit is cui donatum sit hae mortis causa donationes ad
exemplum legatorum redactae sunt per omnia. nam cum
prudentibus ambiguum fuerat, utrum donationis an legati
instar eam optinere oporteret, et utriusque causae quaedam
habebat insignia et alii ad aliud genus earn retrahebant: a
nobis constitutum est, ut per omnia fere legatis connumeretur
etsie procedat, quemadmodum eam nostra formavit consti-
tutio. et in summa mortis causa donatio est, cum magis se
quis velit habere, quam eum cui donatur, magisque eum cui
donat, quam heredem suum. sic et apud Homerum Tele-
machus donat Piraeo.

mode of acquisition because, under the law of the lex Cincia (for which see
inf), as a rule ‘sola promissio non perficit donationem, sed exigitur, ut . . .
et interdicto superior sit is, cui [donatum est] ’ fragm. Vat. 31¹ ε and to
succeed in the interdict it was necessary that the donee should have a
possession which would suffice to make him dontinus either Quiritarian
or bonitarian. They regarded it as a civilis adquisitio probably because
res mancipi could be given only by mancipatio, fragm. Vat. 263, 4. Jus-
tinian's treatment of it as a civil mode of acquisition is indefensible : it is
not gift alone, as Savigny remarks, which confers dominium in any case,
but gift in combination with and serving as a iusta causa (p. 200 supr.) for
traditio, exactly as sale or exchange might serve Again, it is not neces·
sary that donatio should take the form of conferring dominium: it may
consist in the constitution of a ius in re aliena, the transfer of possession,
the giving of an actionable promise, or the release ola debt.

Donatio in the widest sense is any other than a testamentary dis-
position, which (1) is accompanied by consensus between the two parties :
(2) voluntarily, gratuitously, and intentionally improves the proprietary
position of the donee; and (3) actually or prospectively diminishes the
property of the donor. Provided these conditions are satisfied, it may
take any of the forms above mentioned.

§L A donatio mortis causa stands midway between a legacy and a
gift inter vivos. ln that it consists in a present act of bounty (‘ praesens
praesenti dat' Dig. 39. 6. 38) it differs from the former, which confers no
right whatever on the legatee until the testator is dead and his heir has
accepted the inheritance: here, if the donee outlives the donor, the thing
given never goes to the heres at all. lt differs from the latter in being
absolutely perfected only by the donors decease. The gift may be made
