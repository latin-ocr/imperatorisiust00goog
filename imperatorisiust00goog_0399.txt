been lest in his hands on hire oras precarium, (3) to compensate bis
creditor for any loss he might have suffered through his pledging to him
a res aliena, and so constituting in bis favour an unreal ius pignoris,
Dig. 13. 7. 1. 2.

The principle of the real contracta is part performance: their causa
civilis was the fact that one of the parties had done all tbat be had
primarily undertaken. shortly after the fall of the Republic, and per·
haps, as has been supposed, through the influence of the jurist labeo
(Dig. 15. 5. ι. ι; ib. ro pr. 3 ib. ao pn), the Roman contract system
received a considerable extension by a more general recognition of tbis
principle. Every agreement, even though not belonging to any of the
three hitherto established classes of contract, in which an act on the one
side was the consideration for an act on the other, was at length, though
only by a gradual development, held enforceable by action at tbe suit of
that party who had performed all to which he was bound under its terms:
‘sed et si in alium contractum res non transeat, subsit tamen causa, ele·
ganter Aristo Celso respondit, esse obligationem, ut puta dedi tibi rem,
ut mihi aliam dares, dedi, ut aliquid facias, boc συνάλλαγμα esse, et hinc
nasci civilem obligationem’ Dig. 2. 14. 17. 2. The essentia! marks of sucb
actionable agreement thus are (1) mutualiry; there must bea συνάλλαγμα,
e. g. an act must be promised on the one side in return for an act ou the
other; (2) there must have been performance on one side; tbe mere
bilateral agreement gives rise to no civil obligation: ‘item emptio ac
venditio nuda consentientium voluntate contrahitur, permutatio autem ex
re tradita initium obligationi praebet, alioquin, si res nondum tradita sit,
nudo consensu constitui obligationem dicemus, quod in bis duntaxat
receptum est, quae nomen suum habent, ut in emptione, venditione,
conductione, mandato’ Dig. ro 4 1. 2.

Such agreements are by the modern civilians called innominate (real)
contracts ; the Romans themselves do not call them ‘contractus' and in
fact have no general designation for them. Tbough they are roughly
classified by Paulus according to the possible acts which might be tbe
respective considerations for one another (‘aut enim do tibi ut des, aut
do ut facias, aut facio ut des, aut facio ut facias’ Dig. 19. 5. 5. pn), the
more usual clue to their existence is the mention of the action by whicb
they were pursued, the actio civilis in factum or praescriptis verbis (Tit.
24. r and 2 infe), by which the party who had performed could exact
counter performance or recover damages from the other ; against him uo
action lay until such counter performance had ensued, so that, if that
other refused to keep his promise, and his own part of the agreement bad
consisted in a ‘dare,' he could redemand what he had conveyed by the
older remedy known as condictio causa data causa non secuta; or be
was free to change his mind, and sue for reconveyance‚ as it is said, ‘ex
mera poenitentia: ' ‘sed si tibi dedero, ut Stichum manumittas, si uon
