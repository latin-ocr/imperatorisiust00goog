stituatur. Sedet lex Cornelia de iniuriis loquitur et iniuriarum 8
actionem introduxit. quae competit ob earn rem, quod se
pulsatum quis verberatumvc domumve suam vi introitam
esse dicat. domum autern accipimus, sive in propria domo quis
habitat sive in conducta vel gratis sive hospitio receptus sit.
Atrox iniuria aestimatur vel ex sacto, veluti si quis ab aliquos
vulneratus suerit vel fustibus caesus: vel ex loc0, veluti si
cui in theatro vel in soro vel in conspectu praetoris iniuria

aestimata lite iudex hominem pecunia damnabat' Gell. 2ο. 1. The pecu·
niary penalties fixed by the Twelve Tables were 300 asses il the broken
bone were a lree man's, 15ois it were a slave's; lor all other iniuriae
25 asses, Gaius loc. cit. That the grossest libel could be atoned sor by
payment ol this small sum argues the old Romans to have been not over
sensitive to abuse, unless it took the form os ribald songs, in which case
the penalty ol death, fustuarium supplicium, was ordained by the Twelve
Tables, Paul. sent. rec. 5. 4. 6: cs. Cic de republ. 4. ro, Tusc. 4 2. Alter
the introduction os the praetorian penalties, the sum to be paid in cases
ol atrox iniuria (ξ 9ins.) was in Gaius' time practically hired by the praetor,
Gaius iii. 224. ‘lhat Justinian does not mention this is perhaps to be
accounted sor by supposing that atrox iniuria was usually proceeded
against either criminally, § roins, or under the lex Comelia‚ §sint The
praetorian action could be brought only within an annus utilis oi the
commission os the offence, Cod. 9. 35. 5, and condemnation entailed
infamia, Tit. 16. 2 inl. The right oi action was extinguished by the
death either ol the person injurcd, or oi the delinquent, the wrong being
purely personal, Dig. 47. ιο. 13. pr.; this os course must be understood
to mean that the action was neither actively nor passiwely transmissible;
the former, perhaps, because in many cases more than one person could
sue on the same iniuria

ᾧ 8. Whether this lex Cornelia, passed by Sulla nr„ 81, was confined
to iniuriae, or was only 2 part ol a larger statute, perhaps the lex Cornelia
de sicariis, Tit. 18. 5 inl, is doubtful; the former view is supported by
the iulness with which it seems to have treated iniuria, Dig.47.1o. 5.
6-8; 48. 2. 12. 4. Its original object in any case was the criminal pro-
secution of the acts ol violence to which it related (‘ apparet igitur omnem
iniuriam, quae manu fiat, lege Cornelia contineri’ Dig. 47. ro. 5. pn), but
by gradual usage a civil action was developed under its provisions, which,
though its scope was less than that of the older praetorian remedy, had
the advantage of being perpetua, ie. not barred by lapse os 2 year:

‘etiam ex lege Cornelia iniuriarum actio civiliter moveri potest, con· ¹

demnatione aestimatione iudicis iacienda’ Dig. 47. 10. 37. 1. The
criminal proceedings under this statute apparently went out of use, Dig.
. . 2.1.

3 §³ ti Gaius (iii. 223) and Paulus (sent. rec. 5. 4 ιο) do not mention the
position oi the wound as sufficient to make an iniuria atrox.
