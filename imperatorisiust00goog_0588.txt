rtem] DE PERPETUIS ET TEMPORALIBUS, ET C. 575

in heredem non competere, veluti furtivi bonorum raptorum,

iniuriarum, damni iniuriae. sed heredibus huiusmodi actiones
competunt nec denegantur, excepta iniuriarum actione etsi
qua alia similis inveniatur. aliquando tamen etiarn ex con·
tractu actio contra heredem non competit, cum testator dolose
. versatus sit et ad heredem eius nihil exeo dolo pervenerit.
· poenales autem actiones, quas supra diximus, si ab ipsis
principalibus personis suerint contestatae, et heredibus dantur

whom it originally accrued, may still be exercised by his heir, is said
to be actively transmissible; one which, though not exercised against
the person originally liable, may still be exercised against his heir, is
said to be passively transmissible.

Active transmission, as Justinian remarks, is the rule. Those rights
οἱ action only are excepted (of which the actio iniuriarum is here taken
as a type) which are grounded not on a damnum or injury to property,
but on a grievance or insult to the person, e. g. among others, the
querella inofficiosi testamenti, Dig. 5. 2. 6. 2, and the remedy os a patron
or pater against a freedman or child who commenced legal proceedings
against him without the praetor's permission, Tit.16.3 ins. The point of
the distinction is well put by Theophilus, ἔνθα γὰρ τὸ γινόμενον ἁμάρτημα
ι’λοττοὶ τὴν τοῦ μὶλλοντοι τελευτᾷν περιουσίαν, rdrr καὶ ό κληρονόμος, ὧν
συναδικούμενος, τὴν dard τοῦ ἀμορτῆμιποι ἇγογὴν κινήσει . . ,Ἐπειδὴ . . . οὔ
μειοῖ τὴν ὑπόστασιν, elxdrwe eol dxhrypovdposd ἐμός, ὣς μὴ σννοδικηθιὶι,
rdr'rrryv οὐχ ἔξει.

The chief exceptions to passive transmission are tbe actiones populares,
⁴Dig. 47. 23. 7. 8, and (as is observed in the text) penal actions arising ex
delicto. Actions which are purely poenae persecutoriae are passively
transmissible only when they are absolutely the only remedy on the
wrong (e. g. the actio on calumnia, Dig. 3. (x 5. pr), and then only so sar
as the inheritance hasbeen enriched thereby; and this same principle οἱ
the liability of the heir to the extent to which the inheritance has been
benefited applies also to actions (1) which, though grounded on delict,
are purely rei persecutoriae (e. g. actio doli, Dig. 4. 3 17. 1, quod metus
causa, Dig.4.2. 16. 2); (2) which are mixtae, except where an action
which is purely rei persecutoria lies on the same delict (eg. the condictio
furtiva on rapina, Dig. 47. 8. 2. 27). condictio furtiva, not being based
on delict, lies against the thiet’s heir in solidum, Tit. 1. 19 supr, Dig. 13.
1. 7. 2; 1119.

The examples given by Gaius (iv. 113) οἰ actions which, though arising
ex contractu, are either actively or passively untransmissible, create no
difficulty: ‘adstipulatoris heres non habet actionem, et sponsoris et fide·
promissoris non tenetur! But Justinian’s statement in the text that where
a party to a contract hasbeen guilty ol dolus his heir is not suable, ii he
has personally derived no advantage t'rom the fraud, is contradicted by a

large number oi passagesin the Corpus iuris ; e.g.1)ig. 5ο 17.157.2: ‘in
