Re contrahitur obligatio veluti mutui datione. mutui autem
obligatio in his rebus consistit, quae pondere numero men·
surave constant, veluti vino oleo frumento pecunia numerata
aere argento auro, quas res aut numerando aut metiendo aut
pendendo in hoc damus, ut accipientium fiant et quandoque
nobis non eaedem res, sed aliae eiusdem naturae et qualitatis
reddantur. unde etiam mutuum appellatum sit, quia ita a me
tibi datur, ut ex meo tuum fiat. ex eo contractu nascitur

litterarum ; and (4) in transactions ol four specific kinds the mere agree·
ment (consensus) ol the parties: whence the consensual contracts ol
sale, hire, partnership‚ and agency. How other parts besides these were
gradually made actionable‚ though not dignified by the Romans with the
name ol contract (which is less a legal than a historical term) will appear
as we proceed.

lt is difficolt to say why Gaius (whom Justinian follows) discussed the
lour classes oi contracts in the order-Real, Verbal, Literal, and Consen-

. sual. Mr. Poste supposes that it was perhaps the order ol their

chronological development, here following Savigny, who holds that
mutuum was the earliest contract which the Roman law enlorced by
action: lor an acute criticism os this hypothesis, and ol Ortolan’s and
Sir Henry Maine’s theory that there was a time when the Roman law
possessed but one common form sor contract and conveyance (the nego·
tium per aes et libram), see Hunter’s Roman law pp. 352-379, where the
whole question ol the origin and development of the Roman contract
system is well and sully discussed. ’

The real and consensual contracts were said to be iuris gentium : and

to suppose that one os these (mutuum), at any rate in the lorrn in which
we know it, was actionable at Rome before the lormal civil law contract

of stipulatio seems entirely opposed to the general conclusions of
historical law. On the other hand it must be admitted that mutuum
seems to stand clearly apart irorn the three other real contracts: the
remedy on it was condictio, a stricti iuris iudicium, while they were all
pursued by bonae fidei actions; and in mutuum the borrower is made
owner oi the thing borrowed; the lender ‘dat,’ ie. parts with his own
dominium: whereas in the other three nothing is ever transferred beyond
possession, so that the transferor can always in caseos breachrecover
his own by real action. These in lact seem to have been derived from
fiducia (the nature ol which has been already described, p. 315 supr), and
the action on which was bonae fidei, Gaius iv. 62: the difficulty of ascrib-
ing the same origin to mutuum lies in the difference ol the remedy.
