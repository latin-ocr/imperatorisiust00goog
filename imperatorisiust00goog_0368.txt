DE SUCCESSIONE COGNATORUM. ¹

Post suos heredes eosque, quos inter suos heredes praetor
et constitutiones vocant, et post legitimos (quo numero sunt
adgnati et hi, quos in locum adgnatorum tam supradicta
senatus consulta quam nostra erexit constitutio) proximos
cognatos praetor vocat. Qua parte naturalis cognatio spec-l
tatur. nam adgnati capite deminuti quique ex his progeniti
sunt ex lege duodecim tabularum inter legitimos non ha·
bentur, sed a praetore tertio ordine vocantur, exceptis solis
tantummodo fratre et sorore emancipatis, non etiam liberis
eorum, qnos lex Anastasiana cum fratribus integri iuris con·
stitutis vocat quidem ad legitimam fratris hereditatem sive
sororis, non aequis tamen partibus, sed curn aliqua deminutione,

ing to the mode ol division. It this was per capita, all, the joint heirs
who took benefited equally by the refusal or inability os those who did
not; is it was per stirpes, the accrual enured primarily to the benefit
only os those who belonged to the same stirps with thern that had sailed,

nrt V. Pailing sui and the nearest agitate, the Twelve Tables had
given the inheritance to the gentiles os the deceased3 ‘si adgnatus nec
escit, gentilis familiam nancitor! ln iii. 17 Gaius alludes to a definition
oi gentiles in an earlier part os his work, which, however, has been lost,
and the best account we have ol them is that os Cicero, Top. 6, cited by
Mr. Poste in his note on the passage ot' Gaius referred to. Who they
were pre'cisely is ol no practical importance, for Gaius observes that
even in his day the whole oi the law relating to the subJect was obsolete,
‘totum gentilicium ius in desuetudinem abiisse! There was in lact no
longer any civil law successor to an intestate in deiault of sui and
agnates; the gap was filled by the praetor, who through the system oi
bonorum possessio substituted ior the gentiles athird order os claimants,
ranking aster liberi and legitimi, viz. the deceased cognates or next of
kin, in their several degrees of proximity. Between two or more cog·
nates related in the same degree the division was always in capita
