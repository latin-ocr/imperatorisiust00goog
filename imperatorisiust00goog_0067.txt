Q. Scaevola he says, ‘qui quamquam nemini se ad docendum dabat,
tamen consulentibus respondendo studiosos audiendi docebat’ This
practical course of instruction continued throughout to be the prin·
cipal mode in which a professional lawyer acquired a knowledge of
his subject-matter and of civil procedure. The only change was that
it now usually extended over a longer period; a prominent jurist's
auditores continued their connection with him even alter they had
attained a competent legal knowledge, in order to have the advantage
of his authority and advice in their own practice. In this relation
they were called studiosi. Modestinus was studiosus to Ulpian
(⁴ Herennio Modestino studioso meo de Dalmatia consulenti re·
scripsi' Ulp. in Dig. 47. 3. 5²· 30), and Paulus says (Dig. 50. 13· 4)
‘Divus Antoninus Pius rescripsit, iuris studiosos, qui salaria petebant,
haec exigere posse 3' so that studiosi are frequently contrasted with
iuris auctores, as lawyers who had not achieved an independeut
position. Naturally too book learning now occupied 3 larger share
of a student's attention than before, owing to the increase and greater
excellence of the juristic literature.

In the preliminary course which, as has been observed, preceded
the stage in which one became an ‘auditor,' there were considerable
changes in the time of the classical jurists. Systematic teachers 01
elementary legal knowledge arose, after the pattem 01 the rhetoricians
whom Cicero decried (Orat 41. 43), and opened regular schools with a
tixed rate of remuneration. The exact date 01 this innovatiou is
uncertain, but it can hardly be later than Antoninus Pius (3.1). 138-
161); Gellius, who wrote shortly after this period, alludes to a legal
problem which in his youth was much discussed ‘in plerisque
Romae stationibus ius publice docentium aut respondentium,’ and
by the stationes ius docentium (whom he distinguisbes from respon·
dentes or jurists) he probably meant elementary schools 01 law.
These teachers are called by Ulpian ‘iuris civilis professores' (Dig. 50.

not inconsiderable privileges (see inst. i. 26. 15); but they were not
held in any very high esteem, such as that enjoyed by the great jurists,
though some writers have erroneously thought that the latter even
actually engaged in this form 01 instruction. But the old theory
that the teaching· of 3 liberal art should be gratuitous, which was iu

Ulpian says (Dig. loc. cit.) that the iuris civilis professores could not
sue in the courts for their fees, for to make a traffic of such 3 ‘res
sanctissima’ was a disgrace ; though one of the statutory privileges
