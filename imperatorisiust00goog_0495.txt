on to their opponents. To prevent this the former could either bring
condictio ob causam datorum, compelling the holders to prove the
alleged consideration, or in desault to deliver up the memoranda (Cod

4. 30. 7), or protest in the acta oi a court against their validity‚ or
male their exceptio perpetual by sewing a formal written notice on
the creditor, Cod. ib. 14. 4.

Justinian, before whose legislation the exceptio pecuniae non
numeratae could be used only where delault had been made in the
advance ol money by the plaintiff, gave it a larger scope by allowing
it aleo where the alleged consideration was the conveyance ol other
things: ‘in contractibus, in quibus pecuniae vel aliae res numeratae
vel datae esse conscribuntur, non intra quinquennium, quod antea con·
stitutum erat, non numeratae pecuniae obicere possit, qui accepisse
pecunias vel alias res scriptus sit, vel successor eius, sed intra solum
biennium continuum' Cod. 4. 30. 4. pr. Justinian’s attempt to pass
oli the ‘cautio' as a ‘literal’ contract, which is due merely to the
habitos reproducing, ii possible, the arrangement and terminology of
Gaius, is forced and unhappy: the notion os an obligatiorr arising
simply literis does not appear elsewhere in the Corpus iuris, except
so far as the use os scriptura and literae in Dig. 44. 7. a. 1; ib. 38,
and 46. a. 17 may be regarded as a reminiscence ol the old ex-
pensilatio.
