perhaps pignus was regarded less as a iorm of security than asa
device by which the debtor, being deprived oi the possession and
enioyment oi property, would he strongly induced to make every
effort to discharge his liability as soon as possible. This conjecture
is strengthened by the lact that a right os sale was not incidental to a
pignus, as such; if the creditor had it at all, it was only by express
agreement (Bk. ii. 8. 1 supr. from Gaius ii. 64), and to seli it without
such right was theft in law: ‘si is qui pignori rem accepit, cum de
vendendo pignore nihil convenisset, vendidit. .. . suni se obligat’
Dig. 47. a. 74. As a matter of common right, the creditor was
entitled only to retain possession oi the object pledged; he might
not use it: ‘si pignore creditor utatur, lurti tenetur’ Dig. ib. 543 cl.
Bt iv. 1. 6 ini: but where the obJ‘ect was a lruitbearing thing, it
was often agreed that the pledgee should be entitled to the lruits in
lieu of interest: the pignus was then called specifically antichresis.
Pignus then, in itseli, is not a ius in re aliena. The sole right
which the pledgee could assert against the world was the right oi
possession, and this is never treated as a ius in re aliena by the
Roman jurists. The right ol sale, as has been observed, rested only
upon specilic agreement: and even where it had been stipulated sor
the system had grave flaws. No object could be pledged in this
manner which could nothe possessed In relation to some other
species os property pignus was no real security at all: even it the
pledgee were in possession osa praedium Italicum, the pledgor could
mancipate it to a third person (the transaction not being required to
be on the land, Gaius i. rar), who could recover it by real action.
Lastly, il the pledgee proposed to exercise his right oi sale, he could
gire no better title than he had himself ε all that he could transfer to
the vendee was possession. This, it is true, would in time be con-
verted by usucapio into dominium, and in the meanwhile the possessor
would be sufficiently protected by the actio Publiciana (Bt iv. 6. 4
and notes ins.) ; but the inability os a pledgee to make a good title as
