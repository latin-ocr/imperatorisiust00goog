cognito adversus iurem transivit, omnimodo liberari eum
quirem commodatam accepit, quemcumque causae exitum
dominus adversus iurem habuerit: eadem definitione opti·
nente, sivein partem sive in solidum solvendo sit is qui rem
commodatam accepit. Sed is, apud quem res deposita est, 17
custodiam non praestat, sed tantum in eo obnoxius est, si
quid ipse dolo malo feccrit: qua de causa si res ei subrepta
suerit, quia restituendae eius nomine depositi non tenetur nec
ob id eius interest rem salvam esse, furti agere non potest,
sed surti actio domino competit. In summa sciendum est 18

⁴ quaesitum esse, an impubes rem alienam amovendo furtum
saciat. et placet, quia lurtum ex affectu consistit, ita demum
obligari eo crimine impuberem, si proximus pubertati sit et
ob id intellegat se delinquere. Furti actio sive dupli sive 19
quadrupli tantum ad poenae persecutionem pertinet: nam
ipsius rei persecutionem extrinsecus habet dominus, quam aut
vindicando aut condicendo potest auferre. sed vindicatio
quidem adversus possessorem est, sive sur ipse possidet sive
alius quilibet: condictio autem adversus ipsum iurem here-
demve eius, licet non possideat, competit.

was liable to actio depositi, and could not sue the thies himself, ‘nonenim
debet ex dolo suo iurti quaerere actionem' Dig. 47. 2. 14. 3 and 4. He
was also liablc il he had undertaken the custodia, note on Bk. iii. 14. 3

§19¹ The option allowed to the owner of stolen property between a
real and a personal action is noted as an anomaly in Tit. 6. 4 inluster
Gaius iv. 4 Furtum in no case transferred ownership, so that, as the
ownerof the goods stolen remained their owner, the only action logically
open to him was a vindicatio. If the goods had been destroyed, or ir,

thies, his ownership would have been extinguished, and (though only in
this and some analogous casea, Bk. ii. 1. 26 and note supr.) a condictio
