leading feature of this juristic interpretation is perhaps its strict refer·
enee to the civil law, as distinct from other jural elements which were
beginning to intrude themselves into the system: ‘his legibus (XII
Tab.) latis coepit, ut naturaliter evenire solet, ut interpretatio desi·
deraret prudentium auctoritatem necessariam esse disputatione fori'
(Pomponius in Dig. r. a. a. 5); and this will explain the curious use
of ius civile, already alluded to (note p. 28, supr), to indicate speci·
fically law made by the prudentes. This limitation of ‘interpretatio'
had, however, ceased in the time of Cicero, who says (de Leg. i. 5) that
the jurists who were his contemporaries applied themselves also to the
praetorian edict, while their predecessors had not gone beyond the
ius civile. The sphere of their activity was largely extended on the
fall of the free Republic. Savigny has remarked (Hist of the Roman
Law in the illiddle Ages i. p. 25) that the art of public speaking,
which in the time of freedom had been the first among the arts of
peace, had with the disappearance of freedom lost all power and
influence. Yet the Romans had from the earliest time devoted them·
selves more to law than to any other branch of public life, and it was
accordingly in the study of law that the highest and noblest intellects
now engaged, and in which they found the completest satisfaction of
such aspirations as were still tolerated by the empire ¹. With them we
first get the idea of a scientific knowledge of the principles of law or
jurisprudence, a science which was entirely of their creation. Its
favourable and symmetrical growth under their hands was due in no
small degree to a peculiarity which is worthy of attention, namely‚ the
theoretical, scientific purpose of the work by which it was elaborated,
or rather the complete adjustment which they effected between theory
and practice, between principle and detail. The Roman jurists to
whom the science of law is most indebted held themselves aloof from
the mechanica} business which had formed a considerable portion of
the vocation of the older prudentes, and left it to their pupils orto men
of less repute than themselves. Their theory was thus always full of
life, their practice always in harmony with and conducted with reference
to their principles ; with them ‘theory and practice stood to one another
in the only possible true relation, that each paid due regard to the other!
Thus the practitioner could not reproach the scientific jurist with being
amere theorist or dreamer, or the scientific jurist the practitioner with
