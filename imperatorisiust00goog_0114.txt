Tit. 3.] DE IURE PERSONARUM. 101

Omne autem ius, quo utimur, vel ad personas pertinet vel 12
adres vel ad actiones. ac prius de personis videamus. nam
parum est ius nosse,si personae, quarum causa statutum est,
ignorentur.

Summa itaque divisio de iure personarum haec est, quod
omnes homines aut liberi sunt aut servi. Et libertas quidem 1
est, ex qua etiam liberi vocantur, naturalis facultas eius quod
cuique iacere libet, nisi si quid aut vi aut iure prohibetur.
Servitus autem est constitutio iuris gentium, qua quis dominio 2

Constantine, and he decides it in the passage cited from the Code: a
custom can certainly abrogate a statute, but (he says) there is an excep·
tion to this general rule, ir the statute itsels contains a provision that no
custom is to be allowed to grow up in future contrary to its tenor ; a pro-
vision addressed to the subject, and forbidding the custom itseli, not to
the sovereign, and forbidding the repeal oi the statute.

For the pennanence and immutability oi natural law cf. Cicero de
Republ iii. 22, Dig. 7. 5. 2. 1 ς 5ο. 17. 8. By such passages it is not
meant that it is always binding on the citizen, but that what is ‘natural'
once is natural ior ever ; ior, as Ulpian says, ‘ ius civile [iuri naturali] non
per omnia servit’ Dig. r. r. 6. pr. similarly Gaius, speaking nithe quasi
usufruct mentioned in Bk. ii.4 a ini, remarks that though the authority
oi the senate cannot overcome naturalis ratio, its commands are binding,

the laws, ‘legum quum servi sumus, ut liberi esse possimus' Cicero pro
Cluentio 53. 146. Ci Persius, Sat. v. 89 ‘Liceat, iussit quodcunque vo·

§ λ ln respect oi capacity oi right, slavery is a condition oi absolute
‘rightlessness.' Α slave could have no rights against either his master
or any one else ; and, remembering what has been said ol the legal mean·
ing oi ‘person' in the Introduction to this Book, it follows that a slave
was not a ‘person' at all: he had no caput, Tit. τό. 4 ini. The Roman
lawyers looked upon him as a ‘res,' and applied to him, as an object
στ’ property, the same rules which they laid down as to domestic animsls ς
so iar as there is any difference of treatment it is due to the slave’s pos·
session oi reason, so that (a) he is able to increase his master's means by
his intellectual as well as by his physical powers, and (b) by manumission
