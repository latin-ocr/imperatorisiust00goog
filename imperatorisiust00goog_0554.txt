nostrorum conveniatur, in confitentem vero et antequam iussu
magistratuum conveniatur solventem simpli redditur. Itern 27
actio de e0, quod metus causa sactum sit, a ceteris, de quibus
simul locuti sumus, eo differt, quod eius natura tacite con-
tinetur, ut, qui iudicis iussu ipsam rem actori restituat, absol-
vatur. quod in ceteris casibus non ita est, sed omnimodo
quisque in quadruplum condemnatur, quod est et in furti
manifesti actione.

Actionum autem quaedam bonae fidei sunt, quaedam stricti 28
iuris. bonae fidei sunt hae: exempto vendito, locato con-
duct0, negotiorum gestorum, mandati, depositi, pro socio,
tutelae, commodati, pigneraticia, familiae erciscundae, com-
muni dividund0‚ praescriptis verbis, quae de aestimato pro-
ponitur, et ea, quae ex permutatione competit, et hereditatis

§2‘l. The Romans regarded dispositions made under the pressure ol
intimidation <as distinct from duress) as really voluntary: ‘coactus voluit ³
Dig. 4. 2. 21. 53 and the civil law therefore upheld them. They first
became impeachable by the introduction of the praetorian actio quod
metus causa, to support which, however, it was as a rule required that
the threat should have been directed against the life, limb, or liberty os
the plaintiff or some near relative, Dig. ib. 8. 3, and could have been
carried out by the other. lt was said to be in rem scripta, Dig. ib. 9. 8;
ie. it could be brought against any one who had profited by the in·
timidation: ‘nec cuiquam iniquum videtur ex alieno iacto alium in
quadruplum condemnari, quia non statim quadrupli est actio, sed si
resnou restituatur’ Dig.ib. 14. 3. Τὶιε penal action in quadruplum was
prescribed in a year; aster that it was merely rei persecutoria, and was
granted only causa cognita, after a preliminary investigation, Dig. ib. 14.
r ς against the heir it was not penal: ‘licet enim poena ad heredem non
transeat, attamen, quod turpiter vel scelere quaesitum est, ut est et re-
scriptum, ad compendium heredis non debet pertinere¹ Dig. ib. 16. 2.
Tm plaintiff had other remedies in the exceptio metus, Tit. ¹3- 9 ini:
in integrum restitutio, §33 ins, and in the ordinary actions on many
contracts.

528. The origin οἱ the distinction between actions stricti iuris and
bonae fidei is described in Excursus X inf. 'ibe broad general diver-
gence between them is well put by Cicero, pro Rosc. 4 ‘quid est in
iudicio? directum, asperum, simplex: si paret... dari oportere. Quid
est in arbitrio? mite, moderatum, quantum aequius melius, id dari) But
the expression actio stricti iuni, which does not occur elsewhere in the
Corpus iuris, is unhappy, as tending to obscure the real character ol the
distinction3 the ius is just as strictum in a bonae fidei action; what ir
strictum is the iudicium (ξ 30 ini). The principal specific points oi dir·
ierence are as follow:
