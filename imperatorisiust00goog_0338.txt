<possessrorv 325

Possession through the other, though this intention will be implied
where that other is his own slave acquiring ex peculiari causa, a
guardian, curator, or the agent of a juristic person.

(3) There must bea certain legal relation between principa! and
agent. Possession can be acquired through slaves by the dominus
(provided he possesses the slave), the bona fide possessor, and the
usufructuary3 through filiifamilias by the pater (for persons in manu
or mancipio see Gaius ii. 90) 3 through guardians or curators by the
ward, and through free agents by any principal who has previously
given thema commission‚ or vrho has subsequently ratihed their acts
(Dig. 41. a. 1. 203 ib. 9. 34. a). Where the agent already has
possession ol the object prior to his commission‚ the mere subsequent
exercise of will turns his possession into detention3 the possession
vests immediately in the principal. This, which is the converse of
traditio brevi manu, is called constitutum possessorium.

Possession already acquired is retained by the continuing presence
of its tvo elements; but the lavr does not require lor its retention
so much ‘energy' (soto speak) on either side as forits original
acquisition: see Poste, Gaius pp. 646-7. The question how pos·
session is retained is practically equivalent to that how it is lost ; and
it is lost by the cessation of either corpus or animus domini: ‘quern-
admodum nulla possessio adquiri· nisi animo et corpore potest, ita
nuth amittitur nisi in qua utrumque (i. e. aut utrumque ant alter-
utrum, Sav. Possession d 30) in contrarium actum est’ Dig. 41. a. 8.
Corpus ceases so soon as the possessor loses his ability of dealing
with the thing himself, and of preventing others from dealing with it ς
this may occur by its destruction, by his altogether forgetting where
it is, or losing it from beyond his reach (except in the case of a run-
away slave, vvho is possessed till some one else possessos him, or unless
he bona fide believes himself free, Dig. 41. a. 13. pr.l; by its being
stolen, or being talren in possession under a magisterial decree; by
the possessor's being taken captive, or by the thing itself ceasing
to be in commercio. ln order to lose Possession anirno solely,
more is required than a mere cessation of the previous mental atti·
tude; there must be u new determination ol the will, an animus in
contrarium octus, adeliberate desire to transfer or abandon possession.
Consequently, persons of weak or unsound mind and pupils cannot
lose Possession animo solo. ln many cases of course Possession is
lost animo et corpore simul; viz. in abandonment, conveyance, manu-
mission of slaves, and violent ejectment from land on which the

rejected person fears to reenter.
