furtorum, sicut inferius apparebit. manifestus fur est, quem
Graeci ἐπ’ αὐτοφώρῳ appellant: nec solum is qui in ipso ,

sunum manifestum 3 Gaius (iii. 184) gives several proposedtests, one of
which (the finding ol the thies at any time with the stolen property in his
actual possession, rem tenens) he says was generally rejected ; while the
qualification os this with which Justinian adopts it (that he must not yet
have conveyed it where he intended), though accepted by Sabinus
(Gellius 9. 18. 1.), caused difficulty to Gaius ‘quia videbatur aliquam
admittere dubitationem, unius diei an etiam plurium dierum spatio id
terminandum sit 3 quod eo pertinet, quia saepe in aliis civitatibus subrep-
