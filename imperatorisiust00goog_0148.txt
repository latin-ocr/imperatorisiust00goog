statum recipiunt. Relegati autem patres in insulam in po-2
testate sua liberos retinent: et e contrario liberi relegati in
potestate parentum remanent. Poenae servus effectus filios3
in potestate habere desinit. servi autem poenae efficiuntur,
qui in metallum damnantur et qui bestiis subiciuntur. F iliust
familias si militaverit, vel si senator vel consul fuerit iactus,

manet in'patris potestate. militia enim vei consularia dignitas
patris potestate filium non liberat. sed ex constitutione
nostra summa patriciatus dignitas ilico ab imperialibus codi-
cillis praestitis a patria potestate liberat. quis enim patiatur
patrem quidem posse per emancipationis modum suae potes·
tatis nexibus filium relaxare, imperatoriam autem celsitudinem
non valere eum quem sibi patrem elegit ab aliena eximere
potestate? Si ab hostibus captus suerit parens, quamvis5
servus hostium fiat, tamen pendet ius liberorum propter ius

anomalous cases, however, the pater was deprived of his potestas
as a punishment, without the child being capite minutus: e. g. sor ex-
posing his children, Cod. 8. 52. 2, ior compelling them to prostitute
themselves, Cod 11. tot 6, and ior contracting an incestuous marriage,
Nov. ra 2.

§2 Relegation was banishment unattended with any loss of civil
rights: ‘relegati in insulam in potestate suos liberos retinent, quia et alia
omnia iura sua retinent: tantum enim insula eis egredi non licet: et
bona quoque sua omnia retinent praeter ea, si quae eis adempta sunt¹
Dig. 48. 22. 7. a-a„ So too Ovid says (Trist. 4. p 11) ‘Omnia .. Caesar
mihi iura reliquit, Et sola est patria poena carere mea!

§a For the poenae servus see on Tit 3. 4 supr. Loss of liberty of
course entaiIed loss os citizenship, whether the master were ‘poena' or
any one else, Tit 16. 1 inf.

§4⁵ There had always been certain dignities, by the attainment os
which a child in power was released therefrorn without undergoing
capitis deminutio : thus a son who became flamen Dialis, and a daughter
who became virgo Vestalis (Gaius iii. 114, i. 130) were released from
power, though still remaining members of their old agnatic family. The
Patriciate of the later Empire seems to have originated in the old prac-
tice οἱ calling persons of adwanced age pater as a compiiment or tolren
of respect, Horace, Ep. ἱ. 6. 54-55, Νέρων. . ,πατέρα αὐτὸν del ὀνομάζων

Alexander in Cotl 4. 65. 4 Besides the Patriciate, Justinian attached
this effect also to elevation to sundry other high dignities, especially that
