filio variabatur, nostra processit decisi0, qua permissum est ad
exemplum filiae sun'osi filiurn quoque posse et sine patris

from the wife or some one on her behall towards defraying the expenses
oi the married state, ‘ad matrimonii onera serenda' The obligation to
provide a dos was imposed on the father or paternal grandfather partly
by the lex Papia Poppaea, partly by imperial constitutions, and this
whether the daughter or granddaughter was in power or not, Cod 5. rr.
7. The mother was under no such obligation until aster an enactment
ol Diocletian and hlaximian, and then only under exceptional circum·
stances, Cod. 5. 12. 14. This led to a difference os terminology: ‘dos aut
profectitia dicitur, id est, quam pater mulieris dedit, aut adventitia, id
est ea, quae a quovis alio data est’ Ulpian, reg. 6. 1-3: dos receptitia
was a kind of adventitia, being a dos given by some third person other
than a male ascendant on the express condition that it should be restored
to him (dotis receptio) at the termination os the marriage. There could
be no dos unless the wedlock were lawful, ‘neque enim dos sine matri·
monio esse potest ; ubicunque igitur matrimonii nomen nonest, nec dos
est ¹ Dig. 23· 3. 3, ‘ibi dos esse debet, ubi onera matrimonii sunt’ ih.
· 56.1. lt the husband were a filiusfamilias, the dos went to his pater,
on whom the onera matrimonii tell. Anything could serve as dos

’ whereby the property os the husband (or of his pater) was augmented

—ownership, iura in re (e. g. usufruct)‚ rights in personam, or release os a
debt.

Tm modes oi constituting a dos were three in number: dos aut datur,
aut dicitur, aut promittitur. ‘Dotem dicere potest mulier, quae nuptura
est, et debitor mulieris, si iussu eius dicat, institutus, parens mulieris
virilis sexus, per virilem sexum cognatione iunctus, velut pater, avus
paternus: dare, promittere dotem omnes possunt' Ulpian, reg. 6. 1 and
2 ; cf. note on Blc iii. 15. pr. ins. The general rule was that the dos ex·
isted, as such, only during thercontinuance oi the marriage, and at its
termination must be restored to the woman or other person from whom
it proceeded, Dig. 24 3. 2 ; but this might be modified by special agree-
ment, e. g. so as to give the husband a lise interest. The latter became
owner os the dotal property, and so entitled to its absolute management:
‘si res in dotem dentur, puto, in bonis mariti fieri' Dig. 23. 3. 7. 33 in
other passages, however, the wife's reversion is recognised as strictly
qualit'ying the husband’s ownership: e. g. ‘quamvis in bonis mariti dos
sit, mulieris tamen est’ Dig. loe cit. 74.

lt was considered a matter of public interest to secure the return os
the dos at the terrnination of the marriage, as a provision lor the wife, or
in case she married a second time: ‘rei publicae interest, mulieres dotes
salvas habere, propter quas nubere possunt’ Dig. 23. 3. 56. 1. The
husband often guaranteed this by stipulatio, but apart from this there
was an action sor recovery (dotis exactio,§ rainl.) called actio rei
uxoriae, which was bonae fidei in character: ior Justinian's changes in
this matter see Bk iv. 6. 29 inf. The wife was also a privileged creditor
in case oi the husband’s insolvency, and the provisions oi the lex lulia
