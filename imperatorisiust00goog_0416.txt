intellegit quid agit. Pupillus omne negotium recte gerit: uts
tamen, sicubi tutoris auctoritas necessaria sit, adhibeatur tutor,
veluti si ipse obligetur: nam alium sibi obligare etiam sine
tutoris auctoritate potest. Sed quod diximus de pupillis, 10 '
utique de his verum est, qui iam aliquem intellectum habent:
nam infans et qui infanti proximus est non multum a furioso
distant. quia huius aetatis pupilli nullum intellectum habent:
sed in proximis infanti propter utilitatem eorum benignior
iuris interpretatio facta est, ut idem iuris habeant, quod
pubertati proximi. sed qui in parentis potestate est impubes,
nec auctore quidem patre obligatur. Si impossibilis condicio ll

12. 1 supr.

i 10. Infantes are children under seven years of age: ‘si infanti, id
est minori septem aunis' Cod. 6. 30. 18 pr, ‘prima aetas infautia est . . .
quae porrigitur in septem annis' isidor. orig. 11. 2. Pubertas was
fourteen in males, twelve in females, Bk. i. 22. pr. supr.; but tu the
question when an impubes ceased to be infanti proximus, and when he
began to be pubertati proximus, no clear answer is to be found iu the
texts. Savigny rejects the view of those who would decide this by
dividing the seven (or five) years immediately succeeding infantia into
two equal portions on the ground that, on the clear meaning of the
terms, there must be an interval in every child's life when he is neither
infantiae nor pubertati proximus, and inclines to the opinion that children
would be infantiae proximi during the year next after they ceased to
be infantes, aud pubertati proximi during that immediately preceding
pubertas.

It would seem that originally a pupillus could perform no legal act
without his guardian’s auctoritas. The inconvenience which this entailcd
under the old law, which would not permit its solemn dispositious, man· ·
cipatio‚’ in iure cessio, stipulatio, etc. to be made by agents, led toa
relaxation of the rule so far as to allow an impubes who was pubertati
proximus to act for himself in all transactione whereby he could not be
pecuniarily prejudiced (Bk i. 21. pr. and notes supr.) ; and eventuallyby
the ‘benignior iuris interpretatio’referred to in the text the same pri·
vilege was extended to all pupilli after attaining their seventh year.
Consequently, any pupillus above that age could perform any and every
legal act with his guardian's auctoritas: without it he could only‘me·
liorem suam condicionem facere,’ and so could be promisee, but not
promisor, in a stipulation: bilateral contracts which he entered into the
guardian could either ratify or repudiate, subject to what has been already
said on Bk i. 21. pr. For the liability of an impubes ou delict see on
Bk iv. 1. 18 iuf.
