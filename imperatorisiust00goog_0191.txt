178 INTRODUCTION T 0 BOOK ΙΙ.

T ables-uti legassit super pecunia tutelave suae rei, italus esto-and
is expounded at length in Tities 10-25. Certain abnormal cases, in
which a person, though not owner, may, or, though owner, may not
alienate, are noticed in Tit. 8. But the bulk ol the text relating to
dominium is taken up hythe modes, natural and civil, original and
derivative, in which it may be acquired‚ the preponderance ol natural
over civil titles, as compared with the law ol Gaius' age, being par·
ticularly noteworthy. Tities 3-5 relate to the fragments ol ownership
called servitudes‚ which correspond very roughly to the easements
and profits ol English Law. Title 9 discusses the question ol agency
in the acquisition ol ownership, and states the changes which had
taken place since Gaius in the proprietary capacity os filiifamilias;
here too we get a reference to Possession, which is not treated in
extenso, but a knowledge os its rules is presupposed in the Title on
Usucapi0, and is supplied in an Excursus below.

The transition lrom modes ‘quibus res singulae adquiruntur¹ to
those ‘quibus adquiruntur per universitatem‚' brings us to the law ol
Inheritance; the rules which prescribe the devolution ola man's
universitas iuris on his decease. This may take place either ex
testamento or ab intestato: the exposition ol testamentary succession
occupies the remainder ol the Boolc Firstly (Title ιο), are described
the solemnities necessary lor the execution ol a valid will, the
qualification required in the witnesses taking up some considerable
space3 but lrom these formalities soldiers, while on actual service,
are exempt, and Title rr points out the chief anomalies involved in
this exemption. ln Title 12 are stated the qualifications required in
the testator, such as puberty and ‘testamentilacti0,' and the special
precautions to be observed in the execution of a blind man's will are
alluded to. Four successive Titles then explain the most ordinary
contents of a testament‚ viz. exheredation ol sui heredes whom
the testator wishes to exclude lrom all share in his succession
(Title13); the institution oi the heres or universal successor (Title 14);
substitutions ‘vulgar' (Title 15) and ‘pupillary' (Title 16), ansvering
in some degree to the remainders so familiar in English deeds and
, wills. Title 17 enumerates the modes in which a testament might
beor become void, such as original informality, revocation, sub-
sequent birth ola suus heres, and capitis deminutio ol the testator:
and in Title 18 is discussed the querella inofficiosi testamenti, the right
ol certain relatives oi the deceased to impeach and upset his will, for
not having lest them a certain minimum olbis property. The
