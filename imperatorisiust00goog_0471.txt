ln the two cases hitherto considered (legitimi and seeundum tabulas)
it was unlilrely that the other party, who knew he was not heir,
would persist in the litigation3 thus bonorum possessio became more
than interim possession, it had grown into an independent and im·
pregnable interest. In this torm it was employed by the praetor in
favour ol other persons to whom, though not heredes, it seemed
equitable to give a deceased man's property, which must often have
become vacans, the prey of any occupant (Gaius ii. 52—56), by deiault
oi successors whom alone the narrow system oi the Twelve Tables
regarded as having any title. Is there were no legitimus, the posses·
sion was promised to the nearest cognates, and, iailing them, to the
survivor ol a married couple (vir et uxor); and in these cases, there
being ex hypothesi no heir to dispute the award, bonorum possessio
lost its character as a merely provisional interest, aud the cautio
which had been required lrorn the grantee was dispensed with.

Moreover‚ by this development persons were benefited oi whom the '

civil law had taken no notice, whence doubtless bonorum possessio
came definitely to be regarded as an independent scheme ot suc·
cession, standing in contrast with that ol the Twelve Tables The
bonorum possessio oi liberi, and that ol contra tabulas, both ol which
were corrigendi iuris civilis gratia, seem to have been introduced

no earlier than the salt ol the Republic, though the latter may have
existed from the first in favour oi the praeteritus suus or sua,

Eventually, too, bonorum possessio secundum tabulas underwent im-
portant modifications. Originally, it was granted to an institutus in
a will sealed by seven witnesses, whether the latter was valid iure
civili or not 5 with this question the praetor did not concern him·
sels, leaving it to be settled by the civil law claimant ab intestato, it
there were one, bringing hereditatis petitio. Alter contratabular
possession had been introduced, it was granted to the propounder
ol the will it no one claimed contra tabulas. Hadrian enacted bya
rescript (Dig. 28. 3. ra. pr.) that is a will were ruptum agnatione
postumi, and the postumus pre-deceased the testator, the bonorum
possessor secundum tabulas should be protected against the person
claiming ab intestam, unless a suus had been disinherited in the will.
A rescript oi M. Aurelius (Gaius ii. 119-121) further provided that
bonorum possessio under a praetorian testament (septem signis sig·
natum) should hold good even against the agnates: it avalled against
the institutus in a lormally valid prior will only is the person in·
stituted in the praetoriam testament was also entitled ab intestato. In
all other cases the intestate civil law heirs prevailed over the bonorum
