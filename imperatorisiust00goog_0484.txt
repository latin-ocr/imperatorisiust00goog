appears to be that when a contract is sor the interest os both parties, ’

although their interests are rather adverse than identical, each is re·
sponsible for the least negligence2' ‘in contractibus bonae fidei serva·
tur, ut si quidem utriusque contrahentis commodum versetur, etiam
culpa, si unius soliuS, dolus malus tantummodo praestetur’ Dig. 30.

gestio) in which, though the relation is all lor the interest ol one party,
exacta diligentia is required lrom the other; and others in which,
though both parties are interested, they are yet expected to show only
talem diligentiam qualem in suis rebus adhibere solent, e. g. partners,
cohcirs‚ and colegatees.

Accident, fortuitus casus (which is mentioned in Bk. iii. 14. a and
elsewhere iu the Institutcs), and dolus lorm the two extremes ol a
chain ol possible sets of circumstances, the responsibility lor which
may be exhibited thus. For accident, and sor such unintentional
laults and mistakes as could not have been guarded against by the
utmost care, no one is answerable. Culpa levis entails liability on the
classes ol persons enumerated under (r) supr: they are required to
show exacta diligentia. The classes ol persons enumerated under (a) are
expected to display the lower degree ol diligence: they are auswerablc
lor culpa legis in concreto. Culpa lata and dolus entail liability in
every case.

The liability sor culpa in delict is treated in Blr. iv. 13. 3, and notes.
