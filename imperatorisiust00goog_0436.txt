mae] oa· EMPTIONE Er valvnrrrowa. 423

de damni iniuriae actione. Emptio tam sub condicione quam 4
pure contrahi potest. sub condicione veluti ‘si Stichus intra
certum diem tibi placuerit, erit tibi emptus aureis tot? Loca 5
sacra vel religiosa, item publica, veluti iorum basilicam, frustra
quis sciens emit, quas tamen si pro privatis vel¹ profanis
deceptus a venditore emerit, habebit actionem ex empto,
quod non habere ei liceat, ut consequatur, quod sua interest
deceptum eum non esse. idem iuris est, si hominem liberum
pro servo emerit.

enforceable by two new remedies; (1) the actio redhibitoria, which lay
only within six months from the date os the contract, and the objectos
which was to cancel it and recover the purchase money with interest;
(2) the actio aestimatoria (or quanti minoris), which enabled the veudee
to recover a part oi the purchase money proportionate to the defects
discovered, and which could be brought at any time within a year. This
implied warranty and the aedilician actions were extended to sales ol
every kind by the jurists aster Labeo.

ὁ 4. Sales ‘upon approval,' as we call them, could be effected by either
a suspensive or a resolutive condition. For an instance os the latter cf.
Dig. 18. §.6 ‘si convenit ut res quae venit, si intra certum tempus dis-
plicuisset, redderetur, ex empto actio est! The condition in the text is
suspensive, and there is no contract until the would-be purchaser ex·
presses approval, though ii the res is injured or destroyed before by his
fault he is liable in damages, Dig. 19. 5. 17. 2. Where the condition is
resolutive the sale is regarded as pure facta, though liable to becancellcd
by the res sailing to give satisfaction ; and it will be cancelled even though
the ground oi the disapproval be injury to or destruction of the thing oc·

‚ curring without the vendee's fault. lf no time is fixed sor the expression
oi approval or disapproval‚ it must be stated within a reasonable time
ascertained by local or commercial usage.

ὁ 5. ΑΙΙ things, incorporeal (e g. iura in re aliena and debts) as well as
corporeal, and universitates no less than res singulae, can be the objects
os a contract ol sale, provided they could be the objects os a contract in
general as between the particular parties, except lacta, services, and per·
haps coined money. Res extra commercium, if their character is known
to the vendee, are thus excluded (lraud by the vendor is not essential, as
might be inserted from the text; see Dig. 18.1.4; ib. 6. pr.; ib. 34. ²3
ib. 70), as also are (1) things which already belong to the purchaser (ι suae
rei emptio non valet¹ Dig. 18. 1. 16. pn), unless the possession or usufruct
is vested in some other person, Dig. ib. 34. 4 ; 41. 2. 28 ; (2) things which
are furtivae rothe knowledge of both parties, Dig. 18. 1. 34. 3; and (3)
things which are non-existent, unless their future existence is rechoned
upon or at least hoped for. ln the sale of ‘expectations’ and things not
yet iu esse the Romans drawa distinction. An eruptio oi a ‘res sperata'
