DE USU FRUCTU.

Usus fructus est ius alienis rebus utendi fruendi salva rerum
substantia. est enim ius in corpore: quo sublato et ipsum
tolli necesse est. Usus fructus a proprietate separationem
recipit idque plurimis modis accidit. ut ecce si quis alicui
usum fructum legaveritz nam heres nudam habet proprietatem,
legatarius usum fructum: et contra si fundum legaverit de·
ducto usu fructu, legatarius nudam habet proprietatem, heres
vero usumfructum: item alii usum fructum, alii deducto eo
fundum legare potest. sine testamento verosi quis velit alii
usumfructum constituere, pactionibus et stipulationibus id
efficere debet. ne tamen in universum inutiles essent pro·
prietates semper abscedente usu fructu, placuit certis modis
extingui usum fructum et ad proprietatem reverti. Constituitur2

Subject to the obligation not to abuse or misuse (‘ recte enim colere debet,
et quasi bonus paterfamilias' ib. 38), and in the absence of express pro·
vision to the contrary, the holder oi the right may take all fruits οἱ the
object, civil as well as natural ; and where it is land, he may ordinatily
dig for minentis, but not to such an extent as to violate the rule ‘boni
viri arbitratu uti frui debet, causam proprietatis deteriorem iacere non
debet! His general obligations in this respect are contained in the ex·
pressiori ‘salva rerum substantia,² for which see Ulpian, reg. 24 26
‘earum rerum, quarum salva substantia utendi fruendi potest esse
facultas :' he may not use the object over which his right exists ior pur·
poses clearly other than those for which it was designed, Dig. 7. 1. 13 8 ;
ib. 15. 1, nor may he change its character, and he must restore it in as
good condition as that in which he received it. Where the right was
given testamento, the discharge oi these obligations was secured by
a cautio usufructuaria, or personal undertaking guaranteed by sureties: Ι
subsequently the dominus was held entitled to demand it in nearly att
cases. .
