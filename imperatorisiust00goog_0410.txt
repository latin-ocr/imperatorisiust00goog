DE INUTILIBUS STIPULATJONIBUS.

Omnis res, quae dominio nostro subicitur, in stipulationem
deduci potest, sive illa mobilis sive soli sit At si quis rem,l
quae in rerum natura non est aut esse non potest, dari
stipulatus fuerit, veluti Stichum, qui mortuus sit, quem vivere
credebat, aut hippocentaurum, qui esse non possit, inutilis erit

The cautio legatorum (servandorum causa) was employed when a
legacy was given under a condition or ex die, or was disputed: the
legatee being entitled to security with sureties for its future payment, if
it actually became due ; in default he could claim to be put in possession,
Dig. 36. 4. 5. pr.; ib. 5, ib. 16. Thtough his charge of the markets‚
streets, public buildings, ete (p. 22 supr.) the aedile had frequent occasion
to impose duties by the means described in this Title; e. g. the stipula-
tiones dupli, described on Tit. 23. 3 int, originated, according to Theo·
philus, in his Edict.

§4. For the stipulatio rem salvam fore pupilli see Blc i. 24. pr. and
note supr. That de rato (or more fully, ratam rem dominum habiturum)
was employed when suits were conducted by agents, Bk. iv. 11. pr. inf.

Ἧι ΧΙΧ. The contents of this Title are heterogeneous and badly
arranged. Some of the sections, though professedly dealing with the
grounds on which stipulations are invalid, relate to causes affecting all
obligations (e. g. 1. 2. 6. 13): in fact only tt 5. 7. 12. 17 and 18 apply to
stipulations exclusively: the rest form a disconnected account of some of
the causes which invalidate contracts in their inception, especially impos·
sibility of performance, §l 1 and 2: impossible conditions, ξ 11, and dis-
regard of the general principle that a contract can impose duties and
confer rights only on those who are parties to it, §t 3. 4. 19-21.

By ‘res quae dominio nostro subiciuntur' are meant ‘res in patrimo·
nio nostro ς’ πρᾶγμα, ὃ τῇ ἡμετέρᾳ ὑποπίπτειν δύναται ὀσσποτείᾳ Theoph.

§L The ground of nullity in this and the following sectionis the
impossibility of performing the act which is the object of the obligation.
An act or forbearance either may be impossible ab initio, i. e. at the time
at which the contract was made; or it may become impossible subse·
quently and ex post facto. Original impossibility again may be either ab·
solute, as where no one can perform the act (e. g. this section), or relative,
as where, though the particular promisor cannot perform it, another can.
