484 EXCURSUS IX.

Poste on Gaius iii. ¹03 and162, maintains that, with the exception of ·
stipulation, the only formal contract surviving in Justinian’s time,B
could make any contractior A in the latter‘s name, so as to confer
rights on him alone and enable him alone to sue. This is based on
Dig. 41. r. 53 ‘eaquae civiliter adquiruntur per eos qui in potestate
nostra sunt adquirimus, veluti per stipulationem: quod naturaliter
adquiritur, sicuti est possessio, per quemlibet volentibus nobis possi-
dere adquirimus! But in this passage, as has been remarked by
many writers, it is probable that its author, Modestinus, wrote manci·
pationem, not stipulationem, which the compilers of the Digest sub-
stituted sor it as being the only old formal disposition surviving in
their day, and it is clear, from its position in the Title ‘De adquirendo
rerum dominio,' that it does not relate to contracts at all, but only to
the question whether anytbing more than possession in a res corporalis
could be acquired per extraneam personam: see note on Bk. ii. 9. 5
supr. But after all, perhaps the best criticism oi this theory ol Savigny’s
is that oi Mr. Hunter, that il the Roman law had really attained to a
true conception os agency, the lact must have been patent in many
texts; whereas in point of fact its author is unable to support it by
any really pertinent textual authority, except the very doubtful passage
last cited.

Consequently, the agent must make the contract in his own name:
and the desired effect—the conferring oi rights, and the imposition of
duties, upon his principal-was first attained only aster the introduc·
tion of the formulary procedure (Gaius iv. 86, 87) aud in a very curn-
brous and circuitous manner. Ii (e. g.) A, being at Rome, wished to
buy a house belonging to C at Naples, he would give Β (at Naples) a
mandate to buy it ior him. Bdoes so, and then assigns his rights
against C to A, i. e. makes him bis procurator in rem suam (cf. p. 465
supr.); C's rights against B, eg. bis claim for the purchase money,
can be made available against A only by anovatio: is this is not done,
C, ii necessary, must recover from B by actio venditi, and B from Aby
actio mandati contraria. Here none oi the conditions above specified
are realized. A, so sar from alone acquiring rights against C under
the contram, acquires them only indirectly as his own agent's assignee3 ·
C acquires rights against A, is at all, not by the contract os sale, but

by the novation to which A is himself a party3 and Β is in fact the
principal and true vendee throughout, and the only person who is en·
titled and bound in that capacityss In short, the desired effect is not
attained simply byA’s making Β bis agent, but bya double mandatum
auda novatio: A makes B his agent ior the proposed purchase from
