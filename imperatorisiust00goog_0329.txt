‘fiducia est cum 100 aliqua sumendae mutuae pecuniae gratia vel
mancipatur vel in iure ceditur' isidor. orig. 5. 25. The effect 01 the
transaction was thus to transfer the property in absolute ownership
(subject to the trust agreement) to the creditor: hence a striking
resemblance to the English mortgage of realty. Consequentiy, the
creditor could, subject to the terms of his fiducia, deal with itas be
pleased, though any gain he made by it until the debtor lost his right

rec a. r 3. 2: he had the right of sale necessarily, as being dominus,
though if he exercised this right before the day iired 101 payment had
passed he did so at his peril, and 01 11 he could not deprive himself
even by express agreement, Paulus 1. c. 5. But the debtor, though no
longer owner, could stili sell it as well: 101 (Bk. ii. r. 4¹ supr.) he
could not be compelled to transfer to the vendee until the latter had
paid the price, and with this he could redeem the property, and 00
make a good title : buthe could not seli to the creditor, 101 ‘suae rei

contrary, he might redeern the property at any time so longas the
creditor had not yet parted with it Such contrary agreement usually
took the form 01 0 foreciosure clause (lex commissoris), providing
that in defauit 01 punctual payment the fiducia should lapse, and the
property vest absolutely in the creditor: this was prohibited forali
forms 01 pledge by Constantine, hut was reintroduced in a modified
form by Justinian. The remedy by which the debtor enforced his
rights against tbe creditor was the actio fiduciae, condemnation iu
which entaiied infamia, Gaius iv. 180. The advantages of fiducia, as
aspecies 01 1001 security, lie in the fact that no subsequent dealing
with the property by the debtor 000 prejudice the creditor, so that
collisions between different creditore become impossible: its faults
are mainly that only such kinds of property can thus be used which
admit 01 mancipatio or in iure cessio (by which provincial laud was
excluded). and that the debtor was deprived 01 the use and 00100-
ment 01 the object pledged. This last inconvenienoe, however, was
frequently obviated by his being allowed to receive it back on hire or
