INTRODUCTION TO BOOK II. 179

necessary qualifications of the last, and the modes in which they
can accept the inheritauce, follow in Title 19, which also containsa
reference to the vast revolution effected in the character of heres by
Justinian's own introduction of the ‘inventory’ Legacies are treated
at length in Tities 30 and ar, and the successive limitations placed
upon their amount in Title 22. The last three Titles are occupied
with the subject of fideicommissa, trust successions and bequests,
the legislation relating to them, and codicillis form of disposition
resembling a will, but incapable of directly passing the deceased's
universitas iuris, and employed for the purpose of creating fidei-
commissa, 03 01 adding to or modifying 3 previously executed
testament.

No small amount of criticism has been passed upon the grouping
together in one department of a legal system of the topics which are
comprised under the ius quod ad res pertinet, and which, we may
truly say, would not be coordinated upon any other principle of
classirication. The most solid objection is the inclusion of the law
of Inheritance and that of obligations in the same division with that
of property and other real rights. The place of the first is due to its
character as one of the modes of universal succession, among which
it ranks with adrogation‚ bonorum addictio libertatis causa, and (iu
Gaius) conventio in manum, hereditatis in iure cessio, and venditio
bonorum. Through this false idea of proportion the importance of
T estamenmry and intestate succession, as an independent branch of
law, is altogether obscured: moreover, as Savigny has remarked,
these modes ‘quibus res per universitatem adquiruntur' are ex·
clusively regarded as titles to rights, whereas they are equally sources
of obligations. Accordingly, the German jurists‚ in their systematic
treatises on Roman law, bere abandon the Roman classification, and
make Inheritance one of their main divisione, instead of subordinating
it to that between titles to res singulae, and titles to universitates.

Why obligations are ‘res' hasbeen already pointed out. When an
obligatio is said to beares, the active, or creditor's side 01 the rela-
tion is intended. The promisee in a ‘contract, unless the promise is
performed, and the plaintifi in an action on delict, have the power of
recovering damages by action; this partial control over another's
freedom 01 action is money's worth, and falls' under the category 01
property, in the wide sense in which the term bas been used above.
An even more intimate point 01 contact between the law 01 owner·
ship and the law 01 obligations may be found in the ultimate purpose
of the largest and most important class 01 the latter, viz. the creation
