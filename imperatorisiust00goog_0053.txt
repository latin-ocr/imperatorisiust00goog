ephemeral character oi the ius praetorium that the ius civile always
preserved its distinctness and its separate existence.

The political changes which took place in the years immediately
succeeding the death ol Julius Caesar are not unirequently misunder-

' stood. It has been usual to spealr os ‘the establishmeut oi the

empire,' and thence to inier that the form oi constitution was revolu-
tionised, and an open despotism suddenly substituted sor the free
Republic with which the Romans had now lor centuries been familiar.
The real lact is that lormally the constitution remained republican
under and even long aster Augustus; the only outward change has
been not inappropriately described as the addition to the old magis·
tracies ol a new one, which was held for lite, and whose holder was
invested with an authority iar larger‚ because more compact, than that
oi all the old magistrates together. On Augustus were conferred,
sometimes lor iiie, sometimes lor shorter periods‚ but always to be
renewed‚ the tribunicia potestas, the proconsulare imperium, the prae·
iectura morum, the supreme pontificate, and in iact all the highest
offices ol state: but in each ol these capacities he acted merely asa
magistrate of the Republic, whose outward forms he was studious to
observe. Hence, according to the theory oi the constitution, the
supreme power continued to reside iu the populus Romanus, and was
exercised, as before, in the two comitia lor elective and legislative
purposes. Augustus himself voted among the tribes like any other
citizen, and the theoretical sovereiguty ol the people remained intact
until the accession os Constantine.

The legislation of the early empire accordingly proceeded at first in
the same manner as it had been accustomed. Leges are still enacted
in the comitia, though usually introduced by the emperor in person, and
il by some other magistrate, always with his sanction3 lor his tn'bu-
nicia potestas enabled him to veto any project which did not meet with
his approval. GaiuS, who belongs to the middle oi the second century,
speaks ol this form oi enactment as still potentiaily subsisting: ‘lex est,
quod populus iubet atque constituit ’ (i. 3). But towards the end ol the
first century legislatiou by the populus was becuming rare, and the last
lex oi which we have inlonnation is au agrarian lawof Nerva (an. 96-
98) mentioned in Dig. 47. 21. 3. 1. The legislative authority ol the
senate endured longer. This had originated partly in its old probouleu-
tic fonctions, partly in its relation to the administration. ln connection
with the latter, it would seem that even under the Republic its rights
had practicaliy been admitted of regulating the government ol the

provmoes, maintainiug religion, suspendiug or repealiug laws in cases
