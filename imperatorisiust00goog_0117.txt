104 INST IT UT IONUM LIBRI QUATTUOR. [Lib. l.

liberis multae differentiae sunt. aut enirn ingenui sunt aut
libertini.

between absolute slavery and complete legal freedom there were two inter-
mediate conditions. The first ol these is that oi the statu liber (‘ qui
statutam et destinatam in tempus vel conditionem libertatem habet ' Dig.
40. 7. 1. pr.) ; the other is that ol the slave who was said ‘ in libertate esse‚'
i.e. who was matrumitted in some mode not recognised as conferring lull
legal freedorn (note on Tit 5. r ini), and who therefore remained a slave
in the eye ol the law, though protected by the magistrate in the actual
enjoyment os liberty.

from these cases differ certain others in which a person, though
actually free, was subject to an externat control which limited his freedom,
and placed him to a considerable degree in the position oia slave: (1) the
free person bona lide serviens, i.e. who thinks he is a slave; in some
matters, especially with regard to acquisition, he was treated as a slave,
and all that he acquired under definite conditions belonged to his quasi
dominus ; see Blt. it ᾳ 4 ins, Gaius ii. 92. (2) The auctoratus, who hired
himself¹ out as a gladiator, Gaius iii. 1993 the hirer could sue by actio
furti it he were removed from hi's control. The gladiatorial fights were
prohibited by Constantine, Cod. 11. 43. 1. (3) lf a prisoner ol war was
redeemed, his owner had a kind oi lien on him until the whole redemption
sum was paid, and so long the ius postliminii was suspended. (4) The
debitor addictus under the middle law os bankruptcy did not become his
creditor’s slave, but wasbound to work sor him until the debt was satisfied;
see Gaius iii. 199 for a parallel between him and the auctoratus. (5) The
free person in mancipio, sor which see note on Tit. 8. pr. ini. (6) The
colonus. Coloni (in this sense) were persons inseparably attached from
birth to the soil of some particular estate or district (glebae adscripti) lor
purposes ol cultivation ; they were personally free, but as it were slaves
ol the land, ‘licet conditione videantur ingenui servi tamen terrae ipsius
cui nati sunt existimentur’ Cod. 11„ 51. 1 ; under the later Empire they
composed the greater part oi the agricultural population. In many
respects they were completely assimilated to slaves ; thus their property
was called peculium, and was considered, like themselves, an appendage
oi the soil, and if they ran away they could be recovered by real action:
for a longer notice ol them see Mr. Poste‘s note on Gaius iii. 146. One
theory os the origin oi colonatus isthat it is to be traced to the Roman
practice of distinguishing between town and country slaves (familia
urbana and rustica); the latter, being engaged in tillage, seem always
to have enjoyed a certain freedom of action, and came more and more
to be regarded as accessione to the land; their position was actually
much the same as tbat oi the colonus, except that the status oi the
latter was a legal one, and itis urged that the transition from the un·
free to the free condition perhaps resulted from some statute empower·
ing domini to manumit rural slaves on condition ol their remaining
glebae adscripti and paying a substantial rent (canon) sor their hold·
ings. Other writers on the subject however, among theru Savigny,
