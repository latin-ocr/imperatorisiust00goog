EARLIER HIS Τ ORl' OF ROMAN CIVIL PROCEDURE. 617

covered by the plaintifi in a Roman action on delict attest the nature
of the practice, though in thern the ‘penalty’ is usually lixed by the ’
atate, and not by the parties ¹. This less barbarous method ol settling
disputes and claims is familiar to every one who has any acquaintance

with the law ol the Germanic tribes. Mr. Kemble observes² that under
Anglo-Saxon law there was hardly any wrong a man could suffer which
could not be atoned lor bya money payment. At Rome, so lar as
we can judge, it was confined to delict3 lor breach oi contract the
ultimate remedy, even in historical times, remained the right of arrest
and detention ; the debtor who could not, or would not, discharge his
obligations leli a victim to the severe process ol manus iniectio; he
was sold into foreign slavery, or put to death. Thus ‘the remedy for
a wrong to property was against the person: ior among to the person
it was against the property,’ and this explains why actions on delict,
even when partly rei persecutoriae, ‘in heredem non dantur! Adelict
calls for the exercise os private vengeance, which, however, has nothing
to act upon as soon as the wrongdoer is dead; his heir succeeds to
his universitas iuris, of which his leuds and hostilities are no part;
and as the poena is paid as the price os exemption from personal
hostility, it must be paid by the wrongdoer and no one else.

ii. lt is obvious that the exercise of sels-redress required some
limitation, as anarchy began to give way to order, providing lor the
establishment and rendering certain ol claims os man against man.
In the case ol a wrong or a debt whose existence no one could doubt,
the system might, as things stood, seem tolerable enough; but it could
not long be endured il every pretended injury or obligation were to
entitle the complainant to proceed thus against the objectos his ani-
mosity. The expedient which seems to have suggested itself to the
primitive Romans was to require clear and adequate evidence ol every
right or wrong which was not otherwise beyond question, and to
attribute to the witnesses a kind ol interest in thc realization ol justice,

by identiiying them, in a sense, with the person who was supported '

by their testimony ; il the latter were compelled to resort to sell-
redress, they were under a moral obligation to afford him active
assistance; in default they became no less improbi and intestabiles
than the salse or recalcitrant witness oi a mancipati0n³. A ‘testis' is
conceived, originally, less as a witness, in the modern sense, than as

ol actual retaliation, the plaiutill was allowed to fix its amount himself, Gaius iii.
