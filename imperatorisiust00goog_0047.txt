should he governed. In some cases these were settled hy treaty ¹, by
which it was agreed that lega—l disputes between members of the re-
spective states should be decided by a special tribunal, the judges of
which were called recuperatores, though they seem always to have
been citizens of the state in which the court lay'. So far the arrange-
ment was satisfactory, and in many respects more complete than might
have been expected in so rude an age; the difficulty was as to the law
which the recuperatores were to apply. This could not, ex vi termini,
be the ius civile; and we may suppose that the trading peregrini partly
adopted themselves to Roman legal habits, partly introduced a con·
ventional code based on their own mercantile usages, and that the
recuperatores decided each case as it carne before thern on evidence
of the terms upon which the contract was concluded, and with refer·
ence to the generally accepted commercial custom. The trade of
Rome, however, expanded so much with her conquests, and the deal-
ings between citizens and allies of Rome on the one hand, and pere·
grini on the other, increased so largely in number and importance,
that, if only to relieve the praetor urbanus of the duty of appointing
recuperatores upon so many occasions, it was found necessary to
establish a praetor peregrinus in the mode already described: ‘Post
aliquot deinde annos, non sufficiente eo Praetore, quod multa turba
etiam peregrinorum in civitatem venirent, creatus estet ahos Praetor,
qui peregrinus appellatus est abeo, quod plerumque inter peregrinos
ius dicebat’ (Pomponius in Dig. r. a. a. 27 and 28). In addition to
cases which had to be tried by recuperatores, the new praetor thus
dealt with suits to which both parties were peregrini, and for the hear-
ing and decision of which apparently no machinery had existed at
Rome. The procedure which he applied was probably of the same
nature as that which, somewhat later, the praetor urbanus introduced
under the lex Aebutia. Gaius tells us that the action rested on his
imperium as distinct from statutory form (iv. ¹03 sqq), and we may

¹ The oldest example of such a treaty is that concluded between Rome end
Latium, ue. 493. which provided that actions on contract between Romans and
Latios should be decided, after ten days· interval, in the locus contractus, by
recuperatores appointed by the local magistrate. The term was connected with
reciperatio, the treaty: ‘reciperatio est, ut eit Gallus Aelius, cum inter populum
et reges nationesque et civitates peregrinas lex convenit, quomodo per recipera-
tores reddantur res reciperenturque, resque privatas inter se persequantur' (Festus).

¹ Many writers (e. g. Huschke and Rudorh‘) maintain that the recuperatores
were a mixed court composed of citizens of both states. Keller (Civil Prozess.
p. 3¹) is unable to come to aoy conclusion, but Bethmann Hollweg (Ciril Prozees,
ξ ²5) denies that there is any evidence in favour of their view.
