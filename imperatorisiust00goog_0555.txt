542 INS TIT UJIONUM LIBRI QUATTUOR. [Lib. lv.

petitio, quamvis enirn usque adhuc incertum erat, sive inter
bonae fidei iudicia connumeranda sit sive non, nostra tamen

(1)Where the action is stricti iuris, the judge is bound by the strict
and literal words of the disposition; where it is bonae fidei he may
go behind them to discover the real intention of the parties. Hence, in
the latter case, he may take cognisance of pacta adiecta, formless subsi-
diary conventions of the parties, if substantially a part of the disposition
upon which the action is brought, Dig. 2. 14. 7. 5. ln stricti iuris
iudicia this was not possible under the older law, Dig. ib. 7, though later
some exceptions were recognized, Dig. 12. 1. uo, Cod. 4. 32. 123 ib. 23.
So too in a bonae fidei action the judge may rule local or other usages to
be implied terms in a contract, Dig. 21. ι. 31. 20; 3. 5. 7.

(2) Α bonae fide action lies on grounds on which one stricti iuris would
= not, eg. dolus and metus: ie. a party who has been induced by fraud or
intimidation to make a disposition may impeach its validity by the
ordinary action thereon, if that action is of the former, but not if is of the
latter character.

(3) Where a defendant is liable for ‘omnis causa‚’ the value of the
latter is in a bonae fidei action ascertained as from the date of mora; in
one which is stricti iuris (except possibly where it is condictio incerti)
only from litis contestatio, Dig. 22. ι. 38. 7 and 8.

(4) Under the formulary procedure the judge who tried a stricti iuris
action could listen to no exceptio which had not been expressly set
forth in the formula ; in bonae fidei actions no defences which could be
included under the very comprehensive idea of dolus need be advanced
so early in the proceedings ; see Excursus X inf. But under Justinian
the maxim ‘doli exceptio bonae fidei iudiciis inest’ (which occurs in Dig.
23. 3. 21 ι 30. 84. 5: 18. 5. 3) has no processual significance: the stage
at which such defences had to be advanced is determined hy other con·
siderations, as is shown on Tit. 13. pr. inf.

(5) In stricti iuris actions iusiurandum or iuramentum in litem was, as
a rule, inadmissible, but was regularly applied in such actions bonae
fidei as demanded restitution or productiori of property if the defendant
refused or through his own fault was unable to produce or restore.

(6) ln stricti iuris actions the damages were assessed (litis aestimatio)
as at the moment of litis contestatio: in bonae fidei actions at condem-
natio, Dig. r 3. 6. 3. 2.

(7) lf a place was fixed for the performance of a contract the remedy
upon which urias stricti iuris, it could originally be brought at that place
only ; a bonae fidei action under similar circumstances lay at any place
where the defendant was amenable to the jurisdiction; see on Bk. iii.
15. 5 supr.

To Justinian's list of bonae fidei actions must be added (for the older
law) the actio fiduciae (Gaius iv. 62); and the action on innominnte
contracts generally, not merely on aestimatum and permutatio, was of
this character.
