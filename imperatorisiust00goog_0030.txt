PUBLIC AND PRIVAYE LA W. 17

captured booty belonged, primarily, to the state, and that it was
through the state alone that it could become the property oi indi-
viduals. Thus, according to the view now under consideration, no
citizen originally owned an inch of Roman soil; he could only
possess and enjoy it by permission ol the populus, and it remained
ager publicus until the settlement ol large numbers of strangers on
Roman territory had brought into prominence the legal distinction
between civis and peregrinus, a distinction which then became em-
phasised by the former being held capable, the latter incapable, of
owning land ex iure Quiritium. But to maintain the principle that all
res mobiles belonged, ultimately, to the state, was less easy. On one
explanation, however, oi a famous distinction oi Roman law—that oi
‘res mancipi' and ‘res nec mancipi-the traces ol that principle were
retained until the distinction itsell' was swept away by Justinian. It
is suggested that the idea that all res mobiles belong ultimately to the
state survived only in connection with certain subjects of property-
things, in other words, which usually lorm the staple ol military booty,
and of which individuale were thus most likely to have got possession
by concession from the state. This idea, it is maintained, led to the
introduction ol a peculiar mode oi alienation lor these kinds oi ob·
jects, namely, mancipatio, in which the sanction oi the populus to the
transaction was supplied by the presence oi a definite number oi

witnesses who were full citizens ol Rome (Gaius i. 119) ¹. But what·
ever may be the truth as to the distinction oi res mancipi and res nec

¹ This is but one ol' many riews as to the origin oi the distinction. Sir Henry
Maine (Audeat Law p. 275) says: ‘The explanation which appears to cover the
greatest number oi instances is, that the objects of enjoyment honoured above the
rest were the forms oi property known first and earliest to each particular com·
munity. and dignified therefore emphatically with the designation oi Property.
On the other hand, the articles not enumerated among the favoured objects seem
to hare been placed on a lower standing. became the knowledge of their value
was posterior to the epoch at which the catalogue oi superior property was settled.
They were at first unknown, rare, limited in their uses, or else regarded as
mere appendages to the privi'eged objects. Thus, though the Roman res mancipi
included a number of moveable articles οἰ great salue, still the most costly jewels
were never allowed to take mnk as res mancipi, because they were unknown to
the early Romans! lhering thinks that the res mancipi were those objects oi
property essential to the maintenance οἰ the joint family lise: ‘ohne beides [i.e.
free persons and res mancipi] l'asstses sich ein-ordentliches Hauswesen, eine
gesunde Wirthsebaft gar nicht denken‘ (Geist des rdmischen Rechts ii. p.165).
Other explanatione are based on the actual market walue (Kostbarkeit) oi the
objects (Cujacius, Bynkershoek), or on the supposition that a special return oi res
mancipi was required in the census (Puliendors, Gdttling). The matter is iully
discussed, aad the divergent riews stated, in Biicking,1nstitntionen 5 73.
