est et in conductione et locatione et omnihus contractibus,
qui ex consensu descendunt, sicut iam dictum est.

Oi modes os invalidation whose effect is produced only ope exceptionis
the most common are prescription (Ble iv. 12. pr. and notes, ini), capitis
deminutio (note on Tit 10. 3 supa), beneficium competentiae arising upon
a cessio bonorum· (p. 377 supa), and iormless release or pactum de non
petendo (Bk. iv. 13. 3 inf.) ii absolute, i.e. not binding for a time only, or
conferring rights upon the debtor only and not upon his heir. An in·
lonnal acceptilatio was construed as a pactum deuon petendo, it the
creditor’s intention was really to release the debtor, Dig. 2. 14 27. 9.
The obligations involved in the actiones turri and iniuriarum were
dissolved ipso iure by agreement not to sue, Dig. a. 14 17. 1. Transactio
or compromise, by which two parties who affirm that they each haye
claims against the other mutually surrender somewhat oi their alleged
rights in order to remove uncertainty and narrow the issum, implied
a pactum de non petendo, Dig. 2. 15. 16, Cod. 2. 4. 17 ; ib. 24· This same
result ensued from compromissum, an agreement to resera dispute to
arbitration, Dig. 4. 8. 13. 1.
