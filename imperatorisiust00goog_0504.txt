INTRODUCTION TO BOOK IV. 491

mels of law, and so much was left to the discretion of the judge him·
sels, that little could be said upon the matter: the litigant was no
longer liable to be wrecked by the omission of some slight form 3 the
administration of justice had become more ‘patemal,' and state offi-
cials saw that he duly went through many stages in the process (or
went through themfor him) for which the earlier law had left him
solely responsible in person. Knowledge of Procedure was therefore
of less importance than in the old days, and what there was to know
could be learnt less satisfactorily from books than by attending
the conns, to which Justinian himself refers the student (eg. Tit rr.
6). Hence it is impossible to give a really connected view of the
matters discussed in the last thirteen Titles of the Boolr which lies
before us. So far as there ever was a connection between thern, it
is to be ascertained by systematically reading the fourth Book of
Gaius, not that of his imitator.

ln the sixth Title Actions are divided upon *three main principles.

i. According to their content they are divided (a) into real and
personal. A real action is one in which the plaintiff affinus a n'ght
in rem, whether dominium (ξ 3) or a ius in re aliena (§ a); in a
personal action his contentiori is that the defendant is under some
specific legal obligation to him. ‘Prejudicial’ actions, in which the
issue usually is a question of status, may be regarded as a species of
the former class: in rem esse videntur, ξ 13 ; and some actions ‘mix-
tam causam obtinere videntur' (ξ 3ο), ἰ.3. are at once both real and
personal; these are the iudicia divisoria, such as suits for the partition
of an inheritance or other joint property, and lor the regulation of
boundaries. Cross divisions from this same point of view of content
are (b) that which tums upon the plaintiffs more immediate object,
according as it is to obtain mere reparation (actiones rei persecutoriae,
517), as in real actions and those arising ex contractu; to merely
recover a penalty (poenae persecutoriae, § 38), 33 in the actio furti;
or to get compensation and penalty in one (actiones mixtae, ξ 19),
as in the actions on robbery and under the lex Aquilia, (c) according
to the amount of damages recovered, which may be simple (eg.
actions on contract, § 33), double (e. g. the actio furti nec manifesti,
ὁ 3 3), triple (ξ 34) or quadruple (eg. the actio furti manifesti, ξ 35);
(d) that which depends upon the possibility of the plaintifl's being
unable to recover the whole of what is his strict legal due (ξ 36),
owing to the defendant's liability being mere partial or conditional on
bis means: examples of these are given in ξ) 36-40.

it Actions are called legitimae or civiles if accorded by the civil
