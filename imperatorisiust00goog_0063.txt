being made praefectus praetorio, next to that of the princeps the
highest post in the empire, and throughout which he maintained
a moral rectitude and an integrity of character 10 which he owed his
farne no less than to his distinction as a lawyer. After Caracalla
(n. n. 21 ¹·217) had murdered his brother Geta, he called upon Papi·
nian to justify the deed before the senate and people; but the jurist
replied that to accuse a man who had been wrongfully put to death
was as good as to murder him a second time, and steadily refused 10
speak a word in the emperor’s behalf; the refusal eost him his head.
From his writings there are five hundred and ninety·frve excerpts in the
Digest, but this number is no criterion of the authority which he
enjoyed in legal circles. Contemporary with Papinian was Domitius
Ulpianus, who wrote principally under Caracalla, and became prae-
torian prefect to Heliogabalus (218-222 3. n.) ; he met with 3 violent
death at the hands of the soldiers under his command in an. 333.
Owing to the large number of his writings which were extant in the
time of Justinian‚ the aggregate of extractsfrom thern (2462) in the
Digest exceeds that from any other jurist; in fact he contributed to
that compilation nearly one-third of its contents. Julius Paulus, who
satin the council of Septimius Severus (198-211 3. n.) 3ηά was prae·
fectus praetorio under Alexander, vas author of the receptae senten·
tiae, and is represented in the Digest by two thousand and eighty
passages. The series of classical jurists closes with Herennius hlo-
destinus, a pupil of Ulpian, and teacher of the young Maximinus
about nn. 238, from whose writings the Digest contains three hundred
and forty·five extracta.

After this tedious enumeration of the names of the most celebrated
jurists‚ we may turn aslde to consider briefly the nature of their
influence and the modes in which it was exercised, including their
styles of teaching and of legal treatment. The establishment of the
empire brought with it a considerable change in respect of the
responsa prudentium· Under the free Republic it had been competent
to any one 10 profess the law, and to give advice on consultation3
the form and effect of the responsa had been under no limitations.
The influence of the jurists was one which the emperors would
naturally find it difficult to destroy, not only because by its long and
steady growth it had achieved a stature and a traditional position
which might have long defied the direct attacks of opponente, but
because it had always been independent of political rank, and un·
connected with any constitutional office through which it might have
been assailed. The craft of Augustus suggested the scheme of
