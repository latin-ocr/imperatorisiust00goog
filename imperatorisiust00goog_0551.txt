20 Quaedam actiones mixtam causam optinere videntur tam
in rem quarn in personam. qualis est familiae erciscundae
actio, quae competit coheredibus de dividenda hereditate:
item communi dividundo, quae inter eos redditur, inter quos
aliquid commune est, ut id dividatur: item finium regun-
dorum, quae intereos agitur qui confines agros habent. in
quibus tribus iudiciis permittitur iudici rem alicui ex iitiga-
toribus ex bono et aequo adiudicare et, si unius pars praegra-
vari videbitur, eum invicem certa. pecunia alteri condemnare.

21 Omnes autem actiones vel in simplum conceptae sunt vel
in duplum vel in triplum vel in quadruplum: ulterius autem

pose os assessing the damages, aud is the value os the slave killed (e. g.)
had not been higher in the preceding year than at the actual moment ol
his death. For legacies ad pias causas cf. p. 445 supr. and ξ 26 inf.

ξ 20. The functions os the judge in the iudicia divisoria are more sully
described in Tit. 17. 4-6 ins. The explanation of their being partly real,
partly personal, must be sought in the structure ol their formula in the
earlier period. This seems to-have contained two intentiones, the first
in rem concepta, and followed by an adiudicatio (‘ quantum adiudicari
ex aequo et bono oportet iudex Titio adiudicato’ Gaius iv. 42), the second
concepta in personam, 3ηά followed by a condemnatio (e. g. tum quicquid
ob eam rem alterutrum alteri dare facere oportet ex fide bona, eius iudex
alterum alteri condemnato). Mutatis mutandis, the whole formula was
repeated for each of the parties (eg. each joint owner), whence Ulpian
calls these actions mixtae in another sense : ‘mixtae actioneS, in quibus
uterque actor est¹ Dig. 44. 7. 37. 1. Under Justinian they are in reality
in personam only, arising quasi ex contractu, Bk. iii. 27. 3 supr. : ‘finium
regundorum actio in personam est, licet pro vindicatione rei est’ Dig.
ro. r. 1.

The last named action, which was as old as the Twelve Tables, and
had been regulated by a lex Mamilia and enactments of Constantine,
Valentinian 11. and Theodosius 1, was in Justinian's time limited to
disputes as to the boundaries of praedia rustica, Dig.ro.1.4.1o; the
judge was assisted by experts (agrimensores) as assessorS, and neither
party could plead usucapio unless it had extended to thirty years

521. The expression in simplum, in duplumetc. concepta, which
refers to the condemnati0, is another trace os the survival os the formula
in the later procedure. Where a plaintili sues for ‘id quod sua interest'
the action is in simplum concepta, though the amount oi this may far
exceed the verum rei pretium, Dig. ¹9· 1. r 3. pr. ‘Ulterius (quarn in
quadruplum) nulla actio extenditur' means no more than that in no
action does the law direct the recovery os more than four times the
penal unit; sor sometimes the penalty will have no fixed relation to the
value oi the object, and so as a lact will be more than sourfold that value
