sunt sententiae et opiniones eorum, quibus permissum erat
iura condere. nam antiquitus institutum erat, ut essent qui
iura publice interpretarentur, quibus a Caesare ius respon·

omnium sententiae et opiniones eam auctoritatem tenent, ut

(General Introduction, p. 22 supr.) The first Title of Dig. 21. is ‘de
aedilicio edicto,’ and out of his jurisdiction in such matters arose certain
actions oi Roman law (‘actio redhibitoria and actio aestimatoria seu
quanti minoris,' note on Blc iii. 23. 3 inf. 3 ci. Blc ivo 1 ini) imposing
an obligation ol warranty on vendors, at first in maritet overt, and then
in all sales. Stipulationes aediliciae, analogous to the praetortan stipula·
tions mentioned in Blc iii. 18.2 inl, are spoken ofin Digas. 1. ς. pr.

§a For the responsa prudentium see General Introd. p. 50 supr,
and ior the difficulties oi this particular passage, p. 51. Theophilus dis
tinguishes between sententia and opiniones thus: sententia. . ‚drappi-
βολος ἀπόκρισις, opinio perd ε’νδοιασμοῦ προσφερομένη ἀπόκρισις.

5 9. Το the ius non scriptum belongs (besides the mores maiorum, the
national customary law ol Rome) the whole oi the ius gentium originally,
and subsequently such parts oi it as did not become scriptum by being
worked into the edict or other legislation.

Mos is to be distinguished irom consuetudo (in so far as the latter
term has a jural meaning), ior it includes ‘positive morality’ no less than
rules strictly legal: ‘morem esse communem consensum omnium simul
habitantium, qui inveteratus consuetudinem lacit ’ Servius ad Verg. Aen.
vii. 601, ‘morem praecedere, sequi consuetudinem ...perseverantium
consuetudinis. . . cultus moris, quod est consuetudo' Macrob. Satorn. 1t
has been stated in the General Introduction (p. 2 supr.) that originally
the Roman lav existed only in the torm ol custorn Legislation, direct
and indirect, was oi later introduction, but steadily tended to absorb
customary law. The Twelve Tables were in the main a statutory reenact·
ment oi the customs then recognised as binding: others were taken up
into subsequent statutes, the Edict, and the writings oi the iuris auctores,
until in the time oi Gaius, and still more ol course in the period im·
mediately preceding Justinian, there were but lew general customs pos·
sessing legal validity as such, though many statutes and quasi-statutory
rules could be traced in their origin to this source. This is the case with
acquisition by conventio in manum (Gaius iii. 82) and by adrogation (ib.
and Bk. iii. ro. pr. inl), and with substitutio pupillaris (ΒΚ ii. 16 pr. ini).
The validity ol customary law is stated emphatically not only bere and
in Bk. iv. 17. pn, but also in the Digest and Code: ‘de quibus musis
scriptis legibus non utimur, id custodiri oportet, quod moribus et consue·
tudine inductum est' Dig. 1. 4. 32, ‘inveterata consuetudo pro lege non
immerito custoditur’ ib, ‘quae sunt moris et consuetudinis, itt bonae
