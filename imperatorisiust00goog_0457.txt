ξ 2. Cf. Bk. i. 20 supr. and note. The duties which the pupillus could
ensorce against the guardian by actio tutelae directa were, in general,
those os maintaining the sull walue oi his property, and to a certain
extent even ol increasing it. The guardian was bound to keep it in
good order and condition, Cod. 5. 37. 22, 3 and 4, and to sell such parts
of it as were liable to spoil, Dig. 26. 7. 7. 2 ; to call in all doubtful debts,
Dig. ib. 15; if the property consisted mainly of money, to lay it out on
land, ib. 3. 2, or at interest, ib. 7. 3 ; and il he used any oi it sor his own
purposes‚ the rate oi interest which he had to pay was the highest allowed
by law, ib. 7. 10 and 12; to duly conduct all necessary suits on the
ward's behalf, ib. 1, 3 and 4, and -in the discharge of all these duties to
exercise that degree os care which he showed in his own affairs, i. e. he
was answerable sor culpa levis in concreto, Dig. 27. 1. 3. pr. This would
be ol importance where the ward was instituted heir, or lest a legacy or
fideicommissum, Cod. 5. 37. 21, Dig. 26. 7. 39. 3.

ξ 3. This is called by the commentators communio incidens: cf. Dig.
17. 2. 21 ‘cum non affectione societatis incidimus in communionem.¹
The rights and duties oi the colegatees‚ codonees, etc, inter se resemble
those ol socii, for which see on Tit. 25. 9 supr.

ξ 4. Each oi two or more coheredes, is they could not make a satis·
factory partition by agreement, could compel a judicial division of the
hereditas hythe actio familiae erciscundae, in which the iudex also
adjusted all claims which each had acquired against the rest while their
coheir, (e. g. by paying debts, management, etc), during which time their
rights and dutics inter se are substantially the same as those ol socii.
