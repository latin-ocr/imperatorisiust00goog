488 INTRODUCYION TO BOOK IV.

determined by illustrations; the necessity ol Intent to constitute the
offence is dwelt upon; and finally there is an examination oi the
question, what interest will suffice to enable a person to bring the
penal action.

Robbery (Title 2) implies Thelt; the injured person consequently
may proceed by either actio iurti or bonorum vi raptorum, though the
latter, being praetorian, was, so iarasit was penal‚ barred by prescription
in an annus utilis. The distinction between the two offences is that
Robbery is always accompanied by violence; there is also adifference
in the nature ol the remedy, by which, should the offence be treated
as rapina, both penalty and compensation are simultaneously recovered,
whereas the actio furti is penal only, compensation being obtained by
condictio furtiva. A stringent enactmentolValentinlan is here notieed‚
which was designed to checlr violent seizure ol property, moveable or
immoveable, under the pretence that the seizor believed it to be his
own; a plea which excluded the presumption ol dolus malua, and
consequently exempted him lrom the penalties ol both Thest and
Robbery. lt is also observed that to enable one to sue on the latter
one’s interest in the property may be even more slender than is
required to support an actio furti.

The third Title treats ol the lex Aquilia, an early statute which
practieally contains the whole os the law oi lnjury to property, damnum
iniuria datum. The peculiarity ol this Delict is that mere negligence
is sufficient to render one liable to its penalties: ‘non minus quam ex
dolo ex culpa quisque hac lege tenetur? What amounts to negligence
in this connection is clearly shown byn series ol illustratione The
lex Aquilia contained three chapterS, the second ol which was obsolcte
under Justinian. The first dealt with the killing ol slaves and certain
domesticated animalS, and imposed a penalty ol the highest value
such slave or animal had borne at any time within the year imme-
diately preceding. The third related to almost every other kind of
damage to property: its penalty was such property’s highest value
within the last thirty days bclore the wrong was done. Certain exten·
sions os the statute hythe ‘interpretatio’ ol the older jurists, and
by the action ol the praetor, to cases not strictly within its letter are
notieed‚ and the wide meaning os ‘damnum' to be gathered from its
terms is illustrated by examples

The lourth Delict (Iniuria, Title 4) is aimed at the honour, good
name, and reputation osa free person: it comprises such acts as

- assault and battery, libel, slander, and in lact all treatment oi or de-

meanour towards a man by which his character is likely to be injured.
