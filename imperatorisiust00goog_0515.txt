6 Furtum autem fit non solum, cum·quis intercipiendi causa
rem alienam amovet, sed generaliter cum quis alienam rem
invito domino contractet. itaque sive creditor pignore sive is
apud quem res deposita est ea re utatur sive is qui rem

⁸ utendam accepit in aliurn usum eam transierat, quam cuius
gratia ei data est, lurtum committit. veluti si quis argentum
utendum acceperit quasi amicos ad cenam invitaturus et id
peregre secum tulerit, aut si quis equum gestandi causa
commodatum sibi longius aliquo duxerit, quod veteres scrip·

7 serunt de eo, quiin aciem equum perduxisset. Placuit tamen
eos, qui rebus commodatis aliter uterentur, quam utendas
acceperint, ita furtum committere, si se intellegant id invito
domino iacere eumque si intellexisset non permissurum, ac si
permissurum credant, extra crimen videri: optima sane dis· .

flogged, and then addictus to the person he had wronged3 if a slave, he

punishment led to the praetor's substituting the pecuniary penalty
mentioned in the text in ali cases, Gaius ib.; that for furtum nec mani·
festum was fixed irom the outset by the Twelve Tables. The reason why
the two offences were so differently treated was ‘because the legislator
wished, by the amplitude of the legal remedy offered, to induce the
aggrieved 'party not to take the law into his own hands and inflict
summary vengeance on the offender' Mr. Poste on Gaius iii. 1793 cs.

ξ 6. intercipere means the appropriation of ownership, quod alienum
est, sibi habere : the illustrations given here iall under (6) p. 499 supr. For
a creditor to sell the pignus against the terms ο1 his contract was no less
theit than using it, Dig. 47. 2. 73. The person ‘qui rem utendam
accepit' is the commodatarius. .

1 ’1. 111 the corresponding passage oi Gaius (iii. 197) ior ‘sine affectu
iurandi 'we read ‘sine dolo malo.' Sabinus (Geli. 11. 181, and perhaps also
Labeo, had held that a commodatarius should be held guilty ο1 theit in
this case, if the dominus would not as a lact have consented to his using
the res commodata in the particular way, ‘cum id se invito domino
