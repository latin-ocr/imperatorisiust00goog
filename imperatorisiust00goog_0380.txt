against the heres, as directae: Ulpian, reg. 28.12.: cf. Gaius iv. 34 ¹. . . .

the establishment 01 the Empire, and before Hadrian, he was, like the
heres, enabled to sue 101 the universitas by a ‘possessoria hereditatis
petitio ' Dig. 5. 5. For another view of the relation between the interdict
and hereditatis petitio see 00 Bk. iv. 15. 3 inf.

Α noticeable point 01 difference between bonorum possessio and here·
ditas is that the 1011021 was never acquired ipso iure, as the latter was
by necessarii or sui et necessarii heredes lt was obtained originally by
application to the praetor (agnitio or petitio bonorum possessionis),
which could be made by 20 agent, while no one could accept an inherit·
ance except the person to whom it was delata, note on Bk. ii. ¹9 7 supr.
il'his application was usually granted without precise inquiry into the
applicant’s title, which, 11 investigated at all, was investigated later, and
only because it was disputed by some one who alleged that his own right
was a better one. In this case the latter would be granted 2 second and
1010121 bonorum possessio ‘litis ordinandae gratia’ The sons 01 Con·
stantine enacted that bonorum possessio might be obtained ¹from any
judge or magistrate by a mere signification 01 acceptance, eod. 6. 08
2011 9, though this was still called agnitio or petitio ; and this is the rule
referred 10 by Justinian in ξ 12 101. as holding in his day.

The right 10 take the possession could be lost by either express re·
pudiation (i 10101.) 01 lapse 01 the time (specified in ξ 9 ; Ulpian‚ reg. a&
10) within which it was required by law to be exercised. Α person barred
by such lapse was excluded only from one rank or class: 11112 was
admitted by the edict in a lower rank also, he had another opportunity
(⁴sibi ipse succedere ’ Dig. 38. 9. 1. 10 and 11). Occasionally, however, the
praetor would not grant bonorum possessio without an examination into
the circumstances 01 the particular case. For instance, the edictum
Carbonianum provided, that 11 the parentage ol an impubes, upon which
his rights 01 succession depended, was disputed‚ the magistrate should ·
hold a summary inquiry, and 11 10 this his alleged parentage was not
clearly disproved, bonorum possessio should be granted provisionally 1ο
11110 upon security being given against waste, until the question at issue
was definitely settled, such settlement 01120 being postponed until the
child attained puberty. ln cases 01 this sort, 11 bonorum possessio was
eventually granted aiter the magisterial examination, it was·called
bonorum possessio decretalis in contrast with that which was given
under the general provisions 01 the edict (edictalis).

Even supposing the bonorum possessor had an indefeasible title as
such, the praetor did not necessarily guarantee him the succession
against a possible heres, who might have remained satisfied with his
civil law title E. g. a suus is praeteritus in the iather's will, by which the
