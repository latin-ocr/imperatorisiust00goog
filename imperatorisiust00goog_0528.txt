Tit. 3.] DE LEGE AQUILIA. 515

numquam lis aestimaretur. Illud non ex verbis legis, sed ex 10
interpretatione placuit non solum perempti corporis aesti-
mationem habendam esse secundum ea quae diximus, sed

eo amplius quidquid praeterea perempto eo corpore damni
vobis adlatum fuerit, veluti si servum tuum heredem ab aliquo
institutum ante quis occiderit, quam is iussu tuo adiret: nam
hereditatis quoque amissae rationem esse habendam constat.
item si ex pari mularum unam vel ex quadriga equorum
unum occiderit, vel ex comoedis unus servus fuerit occisus:
non solum occisi fit aestimatio, sed eo amplius id quoque

Tbe action was maintainable against the delinquent’s heir sofar as the
inheritance had been enriched by the delict: ‘in heredem vel ceteros
(successores) haec actio non dabitur, curn sit poenalis (see Tit. 12. 1 inf),
nisi forte ex damno locupletior heres factus sit' Dig. q 2. 23. 8. Justi-
nian’s qualification in the text (quae transitura. . . . aestimaretur) is
irreconcileable with the statements of the older jurists, and tends only to
confusion. ,

‘Aliquando longe pluris,' i. e. not always: for the slave (eg.) may have
been at his full value when killed, and the defendant may in the abstract
admit his liability, the object of the suit being solely to assess the damages:
cf. Tit. 6. 19 inf. ‘. . . . sed interdum,' etc.

i 10. When one person has to pay another the value of a thing or act,
two standards may be taken, the market value, verum rei pretium
(Sachwerth); or its valne to the particular person to whom the payment
is to be made, in other words, his ‘interesse’ When the latter standard
is adopted, allowance is made not only for the market value, but also for
what are called damnum indirectum or'emergens (illustrated by the team
of mules and company of actors in the text) and lucrum cessans (eg. the
slave who hasbeen instituted heir, and is killed before he can benefit his
master by accepting); the damages are assessed upon the principle of
putting the plaintiff so far as possible in the position in which he would
have been had the act been done which ought to have been done, or had
the wrongful act never been committed. The expression ‘quanti ea res est’
or ‘fuit' (in actiones arbitrariae ‘erit’) is used to denote both of these
standards: ‘haec verba, quanti eam rem paret esse, non ad qnod in-
terest, sed ad rei aestimationem referuntur' Dig. 50. 16. 193, ‘quanti ea
res est, cuius damni infecti nomine cautum nouerit, iudicium datur, quod
non ad quantitatem refertur, sed ad id, quod interest, et ad utilitatem
venit, non ad poenam' Dig. 39. 2. 4. 7.

'lhe plaintiff’s interesse was the standard in actions both on delict
(except the actio bonorum vi raptorum, Dig. 47. 8. 2. 1 3) and on breaches
of contract involving dolus or imputable culpa. justinian points out

, that by the text of the lex Aquilia only the verum rei pretium could be
claimed3 the change of standard was due to the ‘interpretatio’ of the
