But, even long before the time of Gaius, the character 01 expensilatio
(with which, as a formal contract, stipulatio may be coordinated) had
been vitally altered. These two contracts had for centuries resembled
the English Deed in imposing an obligation by their mere form: once
made, the debtor was bound, and must pay, whether he had or had
not received the consideration ior which he purported to have made
the promise or consented to the entry, and even though his promise
or consent had been obtained by duress, fraud, or misrepresentation.
Some time, however, before Cicero, a praetor by name Cassius (Dig.
44. 4. 4. 33), had introduced the exceptio doli mali, by which a man,
when sued on aformal contract vitiated hy want 01 consideration or
01 good faith generally, was enabled to repel the plaintiff. In con·
tracts which were bonae fidei such aformal ples was unnecessary:
for ‘doli exceptio inest bonae fidei iudiciis' Dig. 24· 3. ²13 and in a
condictio brought on a mutuum the defence 01 no consideration would
. be a direct traverse of the plaintiff’s right, upon whom consequently
would fall the burden of showing that the money had in point 01 fact
been advanced to the defendant. Mr. Poste (Gaius p. 389) seems to
think that the exceptio doli was not universally pleadable to condic-
tiones until the time of Marcus Aurelius ; but the passage in the Insti-
tutes (Bk. iv. 6. 30) upon which this supposition is based relates only
to the application 01 this plea io the introduction of a setoff (compen-
satio) in such suits. It is obvious that Cassius’ innovation entirely
changed the material character 01 stipulatio and expensilatio. Osten-
sibly, they continued to hind in virtue of their form alone: practically,
as fraud, absence 01 consideration, etc. would enable the promisor, hy
pleading exceptio doli, to defeat any action brought against him by
the other party, they were ‘transformed into real contracta, the obli-
gation 01 the promisor depending on the performance of the promisee
(re), that is, on the execution by the promisee of his part 01 the con·
sideration, not on the solemnity 01 the spoken words (verbis) or writ-
ten documents (literisll

Eventually, when the defendant's plea was in effect that the pro-
mised pecuniary consideration, by which his own promise had been
obtained, had not, in point 01 fact, been given (ie. when it was in
factum composita), it came to be called the exceptio pecuniae non
numeratae, which Justinian says in the Code is a species 01 the excep·
tio doli, with which indeed it is in Cod. 4. 30. 3 actually identified:
cf. notes on Bk. iv. 13. rand a inl. From a comparison of Gaius iv.
116 with those paragraphs it would seem that the new name had not
yet been given in the fonner's time. Upon the plea 01 pecunia non
