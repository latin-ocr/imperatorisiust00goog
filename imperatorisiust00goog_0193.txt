of real rights, or the communication of their exercise and enjoyment¹.
This coordination however of obligations with rights in rem is re·
garded by the Austinian school as an egregious error of arrangement,
on the ground that the distinction between rights, according as they
are real or personal, is a radical one for purposes of classification:
yet it is adopted by the continental writers on Roman law, who sub·
divide Vermdgensrecht, or Property law, into Sachenrecht, com·
prising ownership, possession, and iura in re aliena, and the law of
obligations, whether arising ex contractu or ex delicto. indeed, the
very treatment of contracte and delicts together, as facts or events
frorn which obligations arise, is considered faulty by Mr. Hunter,
because, as he alleges, the sole connection between them was that
they formed two subdivisions of actiones in personam. ‘ln the state·
ment of claim it was alleged that the defendant ought to do or pay
something. In an action, then, upon a conuact or delict, the for-
mulae were very similar, while both stood in marked contrast to the
formula in an actio in rem. It is easy to understand, therefore, why
the Roman writers included contract and delict under the common
designation of obligatio’ (Roman Law, Introduction p. xxxvi). Itis
not however the action, but the right which the action is designed
to enforce, to which attention should he directed3 and whether a
man refuses to perform his contract, or violates a right in rem, the
right which arises from the refusal or the violation is a right in per·
sunam It may be replied that this involves a confusion between
antecedent and remediat rights: but this is a purely party objection
which Gaius could not have been expected to answer. On the other
hand, Mr. Hunter rnay himself be met by the charge that he regards
contracts from the wrong point ol view. A contract may be analysed
into two elements, the agreement or promise, and the obligation which
is annexed to it by law. Now Roman and modern law differ as

Ι regards the importance which they respectively attribute to these two

elements: the former bringing the obligation into the foregronnd,
the latter rather dwelling on the consensus of the parties. Yet the
Roman view here seems to be strictly correct and lawyerlike, fora
promise without an obligation, such as English lawyers call a nudum
pactum, is in the eye of the law non-existent, while an obligation has
an independent legal existence; it is the obligation, consequently,
which for legal purposes should be deemed of primary importance,
and constituted a summurn genus for purposes of classification. 1f
contracta are not to stand isolated and out of all connection with
