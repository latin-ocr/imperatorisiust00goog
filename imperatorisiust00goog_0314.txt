eam Gaio Seio reddas restituas! potest autem quisque et de
parte restituenda heredem rogare: et liberum est vel pure
vel sub condicione relinquere fideicommissum vel ex die
certo.

Restituta autem hereditate is quidem qui restituit nihiloa
minus heres permanet: is vero qui recipit hereditatem

missum was called a fideicommissaria hereditas if the heir was requested
to transfer either the whole inberitance, or some definite fraction of it, to .
the intended beneficiary: this following the analogy of a genuine heir-
ship, in which a person is heres though instituted in a very small fraction
of the succession as a whole: in other words, as a man was directus heres
who was instituted in only a tenth, or a fiftieth, of the inheritance, so he
was regarded as heres fideicommissarius, and entitled to a fideicommis-
saria hereditas, if the instituted heir was requested to transfer to him
some definite quota of the universal succession, see § 7 inf. Nor, as
might be hastily inferred from the text, was it essential that there should
be a will: a fideicommissaria hereditas could be created by a person
charging bis heredes ab intestato with the restitution of the succession
either in whole orin part: ‘meminisse autem oportebit de herede instituto
senatum loqui: ideoque tractatum est apud Iulianum, ad intestatos locum
habeat: sed est verius eoque iure utimur, ut hoc senatusconsultum ad
intestatos quoque pertineat, sive legitimi sive honorarii sint successores'
Dig. 36. 1. 6. 1 ; cf.§ ro inf.

§ 8. Before the legislation mentioned in the next section‚ the effect of
a request to the heres to transfer to some other person the hereditas or
some definite fraction of it had not been to produce anniversal succession
in the proper sense of the term. Tne transfer was at that time effected
under the guise of a sale at a nominal price (‘ nummo uno' Gaius ii. 252), and
the heir under the will (heres fiduciarius), and the transferee entered into a
contract by reciprocal stipulations (stipulationes quasi emptae et venditae
. hereditatis); the former bargaining that he should be indemnifred, in pro·
portion to the quota of the hereditas which he transferred, against all judg-
ments, legal expenses, etc. incurred by him as heir, the latter, that the other
should hand over to him his due share of the present or subsequent
asset5,and allow him if necessary to sue as his agent upon debts owed to
the testator, Gaius ii. 2 52. ln other words, the maxim semel heres semper
heres was consistently adhered to: the institutus, being charged with the
transfer of so large a share of the succession that otherwise it would not
be worth his while to accept, considering the liabilities with which be was
saddled, was only induced to do so by the transferee’s expressly under-
taking to bear a fair share in all debts and other expensas which he ,
incurred as heir.

This section is wrongly placed, as it refers really to the law as it stood
aster the passing of the SC0. Trebellianum and Pegasianum.
