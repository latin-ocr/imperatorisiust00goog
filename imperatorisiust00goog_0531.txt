suerit, sed alio modo damnum alicui contigit, cum non sufficit ⁴

inf. in the General Index, and lor the specific one mentioned in this
sectiones. Dig. 19 5. 11 ‘quia actionum non plenus numerus esset, ideo
plerumque actiones in iactum desiderantur. Sed et eas actiones, quae
legibus proditae sunt, si lex iusta ac necessaria sit, supplet praetor in eo,
quod legi deest ; quod t'acit in lege Aquilia reddendo actiones infactum
accommodatas legi Aquiliae, idque utilitas eius legis exigit) lt is difficult
to determine at all precisely the relation.to one another os this actio in
facturn aud the actio utilis legis Aquiliae also mentioned in the text.
, Justinian's own statement here suggests the hypothesis that the'actio
utilis was the proper remedy where the damage was done corpori, but not
corpore, while where it was not even done corpori the injured person had
only an actio in iactum; but this distinction is not even hinted at by
Gaius iii. 219, and other passages in ‘the Digest, some of which are cited
below, are strongly against it. The only conclusion which seems to be
warranted is that in all cases which had been brought within the scope os
the statute by construction an actio in factum lay, but that the actio
utilis had a less extensive application, or, as one oi the Scholiasts puts it,
‘nota etiam ex hoc capite, aliud esse in lactum, et aliud utilem Aquiliam;
utilis quidem Aquilia est in facturn, at in factum non est utilis Aquilia; haec
enim latius patet et aliis casibus competit! Tbere seems to be no other
difference between the two remedies, and, in particular, none in respect
of their material result, though some writers maintain that by the actio
in facturn only simple damages were recoverable, but that the actio utilis
was penal in both senses ol the lex Aquilia, ξ 9 supr. and note. For this
there is no textual authority, and the expression actio in sactum ‘accom-
modata legi Aquiliae’ (Dig. 19. 5. 11, cited supr.) or ‘ad exemplum legis
Aquiliae' (Dig. 9. 2. 53) is distinctly against it.

The cases to which the penalties oi the lex Aquilia were extended by

construction, besides that already noticed in the note on p. 512, are as
follow ε

(1) Indirect killing (corpori, non corpore): ‘Celsus autem multum
interesse dicit, occiderit, an mortis causam praestiterit, ut qui mortis
causam praestiterit, non Aquilia sed in sactum actione teneatur. Unde
affert eurn, qui venenum pro medicamento dederit, et ait causam mortis
praestitisse, quemadmodum eunt, qui furenti gladium porrexit, nam nec
' hunc lege Aquilia teneri, sed in sactum' Dig. 9. 2. 7. 6. For this the text
before us prescribes actio utilis: cs. Dig. ib. 9. 3 ; ib. 11. 1.

(2) Indirect damage other than killing (corpori, non corpore): for
examples see the text, and Dig. 9. 2. 11.5; ib. 29. 53 ib. 3o 33 9.1. 1.7;

19. 5. 14. 3. For the limitation os these classes oi wrong by the require-
ment of a positive act see on §osupr

(3) Cases in which damnum is not done corpori, so that properly
