GROWTH OF IMPERIAL LEGISLATION. 57

right and ought to be done. Now the peoples 31 whom the empire
was composed were so diverse that they had but one characteristic
in common, viz. that they were not Romans. They could have no
common legal habit as a nation, and thus could generate no new
positive customary law save merely local rules; the only influence
they could unite to exereise was a negative one, to abandon all such
portions 31 the system as were purely and exclusively Roman. And
this destructive work, 33 we have seen, they did dt). So with the
other sources 31 the ius scriptum which are enumerated in the
Institutes (i. 2. 3). Leges proper, plebiscita, and senatus consulta,
33 we know, had long been obsolete; and by the ordinance cited a

few lines above, Constantine had given the last blow to the edicta ·

magistratuum. Still, the development 31 law might have been carried
on, as it had been 13333 Augustus to Maximian, by the responsa
prudentium and systematie treaties 31 authorized jurists; but we look

in vain 133 these forms 31 legal activity, 133 true jurisprudence had
already died 3 natural death. The juristic literature 31 the period
now under consideration consists merely 31 compilatione irom statutes ·
or constitutions and 13333 the writings 31 earlier prudentes. Theodo-
sius 11 (nn. 408-450) attests the cessation 31 true juristic work in

the enactment by which he promulgated 1313 codex constitutionum:
‘soepe nostra clementia dubitavit, quae causa iaceret, ut tantis pro-
positis praemiis, quibus artes et studia nutriuntur, tam pauci raroque
extiterint, qui plena iuris civilis scientia ditarentur, et intanto lucu·
brationum tristi pallore vix unus aut alter receperit soliditatem per.-
iectae doctrinae! His own explanation 31 the phenomenon is the
vast multiplicity 31 imperial ordinances and iuristic books without an
adequate study 31 which a knowledge 31 the law was impossible ; and
the hope is expressed that 3 remedy ior this will be afforded by the
comparatively small dimensione 31 his own compilation.

Direct imperial legislation thus remained the only iorm in which
changes could be etiected in positive law. What Justinian says in
Cod. r. 14. ra is true 31 the whole period extending backward 13333
himself to Constantine: ‘In praesenti leges condere soli imperatori
eoncessum est, et leges interpretari solum dignum imperio esse
oportet ;' and this will account 133 the ever-increasing activity 31 the
imperial legislation. In the interval 31 r 30 years between Constan-
tine and Theodosius II the mass 31 general constitutions had already
become so great that the latter emperor’s compilation formed a book
31 very considerable dimensions, and yet in this rnuch was curtailed,
still more omitted ; 133 instance, it contained none 31 the enactmente
