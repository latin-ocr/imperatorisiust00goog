Tit. 15.] DE VERBORUM OBLIGA Τ IONE. 391

bitur. Sub condicione stipulatio lit, cum in aliquem casuml
differtur obligatio, ut, si aliquid sactum suerit aut non luerit,

stipulatio committatur, veluti ‘si Titius consul sactus suerit,
quinque aureos dare spondes?’ si quis ita stipuletur ‘si in
Capitolium non ascendero, dare spondesl' perinde erit, ac
si stipulatus esset cum morietur dari sibi. ex condicionali
stipulatione tantum spes est debitum iti, eamque ipsam spem
transmittimus, si, priusquam condicio existat, mors nobis

annuity os 100 aurei for live years, 500 might be promised in five equal
shares ex die; or instead oi promising 100 per annum lor a person's
lisetime, a number oi separate promises os 100 might be made ex die,
each under the suspensive condition oi the promisee's living to such
or such a birthday.

§ 4. We have seen (ξ 2 supr.) that an immediate, though not necessarily
a civil, obligation arose from a promise ex die ; e. g. Kalendis Martiis dare
spondes? A promise made subject to a suspensive condition—e. g. si
Titius consul fuerit factus—might at first sight seem to have no legal
eti'ect at all: ‘ante condicionem non recte agi, cum nihil ad interim de·
beatur’ Dig. ao. 1. 13. 5. Yet this is clearly not so in sact3 sor(1) it is
said in the text that the promisee's hope ol the condition being iulfilled,
and os the debt so springing into actual existence, passes to his heres;
if the conditional promise had no effect until condicio existit there could
be nothing to pass to the heir at all, cf. Tit. 19· 2 5 ini. lt was otherwise
with legacies, on account os their strictly personal nature: unless the ¹
condition were sulfilled before the legatee’s decease the latter’s heir was
not benefited, Dig. 36. 2. 5. pr. and 2, Cod. 6. 51. 73 cs. note on Bk. ii.
20. 20 supr. (2) The person who will be bound toan act or forbearance
on the fultilment ol the condition is unable by any act ol his own to
escape his possible liability in the future : pro tanto he is bound already.
This may be illustrated by Dig. 17. 2. 27 ‘si (socius) sub condicione
promiserat et distracta societate condicio extitit, ex communi solvendum
est,’ Dig. 45. r. 78. pr. ‘si filiusfamilias sub condicione stipulatus einan- ,
cipatus fuerit, deinde extiterit condicio, patri actio competit ;’ cr'. Dig. 20.
1. η 5 ; 45. 3. 26. (3) Even more direct is Dig. 44 7. 42. pr. ίἱε, cui sub
condicione legatum est, pendente condicione non est creditor, sed tunc
curn extiterit condicio, quamvis eum, qui stipulatus est sub condicione,
placet etiam pendente condicione creditorem esse! Dig. 12. 6. 16, however,
shows that the language here is unguarded, and that until the condition
is tuttitted there was no real obligatio, even naturalis, lor is payment were
made pendente condicione the money could be recovered by condictio
indebiti: ci. Dig. ib. 18; ib. 443 ib. 56. Thus the legal position of a
promisee sub condicione is difficult to describe ; there is as yet no obli·
gation, and yet he is not absolutely without right; the effect ol the
promise until the condition is iulfilled is only, as Fitting calls it, ‘pre-
liminary' (Vorwr‘rkung).
