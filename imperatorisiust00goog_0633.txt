favour among the Romans. When political authority has at length
obtained a firm footing, the magistrate is gradually preferred by liti·
gants to a citizen arbitrator, perhaps from a conviction of his greater
wisdom and impartiality; if he is a king, perhaps too because his
divine descent is believed to confer upon him a sense of right, and a
kind of knowledge, above bis merely burnan fellows. Finally, the
judicial function is recognised as appertaining to the state; though
the primitive remedies may to some extent survive in all their rude·
ness, and though the atate administration of justice may still more
widely bear traces of tire social condition which preceded political
organisation, still the natural mode of deciding a dispute is to go to
the magistrate, and rules of civil procedure have begun to assume
consistency. Courts have become established ; their mode of action
is prescribed by law; any attempt -to evade their authority by recur-
ring to other methods of obtaining satisfaction, save iu certain well
defined cassaira considered a defiance of law, and a breach of the
peace.

This is the condition of the earliest judicial institutione at Rome
of which we have any information. Gaius telis us that the formulary
procedure which was in use in his time had superseded a system of
‘Statute-Process,' which presente to us all the characteristic features
ofa nascent jndicature. There were but five forms of redress for
wrong, called legis actiones, a name of which two alternative explana·
tions are given by Gaius (iv. 11). Three of these are genuine ac·
lions ; the other two are anomalous, for, though called ‘actiones'
they are clearly ‘survivals' from the older system of sels-redress, and
seem at first sight to have little in common with an action in the
ordinary sense of the word: ‘they cannot' (says Sir H. Μειὶῐιε)ί be made
to square in any way with our modern conception of an action! One
of these is pignoris capio, which Gaius (iv. 29) says some refused to
regard as a legis actio at all, among other reasons because of its
extra-judicial character. In point of fact, it is the old practice of
distraint, restricted by the encroachments of a more civilized pro·
cess to certain iimited kinds of claims ofa public or reiigious nature,
and even then to be successfully applied only by careful observance
of prescribed forms of speech and action. lt could be used by a

soldier against the tribunus aerarius for arrears of pay ¹, and by the
cavalry in order to procure money for the purchase of a horse and
his corn (aes equestre, aes hordeariurn); its employment in these
cases was anterior to all recorda (Gaius iv. 2⁶). By the Twelve Tables
