tollat quis aedes suas, ne luminibus vicini officiatur. ln rusti-2
comm praediorum servitutes quidam computari recte putant
aquae haustum, pecoris ad aquam adpulsum, ius pascendi,
calcis coquendae, harenae fodiendae.

Ideo autem hae servitutes praediorum appellantur, quoniam 3
sine praediis constitui non possunt. nemo enim potest ser·
vitutem adquirere urbani vel rustici praedii, nisi qui habet
praedium, nec quisquam debere, nisi qui habet praedium. Sir
quis velit vicino aliquod ius constituere, pactionibus atque

non avertendi, which seem to operate only in the way of freeing a
building from some pre-existing obligation. Mr. Poste (Gaius p. 179)
explains this by supposing that an urban servitude can be extinguished
only by the acquisition oi a contrary servitude by the praedium serviens.
But perhaps it is better to suppose that these anomalous servitudes
occurred only where the laws limited the rights os owners by forbidding
thern to build above a certain height, compelling them to receive their
neighbours’ rainwater, etc. A law os Zeno of this nature, enacted origin·
ally ior Constantinople only, was extended to all the cities of the empire
by Justinian (Cod. 8. ro. 12 and 13). li this is so, it is difficult to cou-
ceive the right in question as a servitude at all.

§ 2. The rights mentioned in this section are treated as rustic
servitudes by Neratius (Dig. 8. 3. 2 sq), and by Papinian, Paulus, and
Ulpian. The word ‘recte’ seems to imply that by some they were not
so considered, though there is no trace in the authorities oi a difference
ot' opinion.

ξ 4. The old mode oi constituting servitudes between the parties had
been in iure cessio, Gaius ii. 29. 30, mstic servitudes in Italy also ad·
mitting os creation by mancipatio. These processes, however, could be
employed only in respect of objects which could themselves be trans·
ferred in the same manner, so that (Gaius ii. 31) servitudes over praedia
provincialia, which were not ‘in patrimonio,' could not thus be created.
ln deiault, the occupiers oi land in the provinces resorted to bare agree-
ments (pactio), subsequently expressed in aformal and solemn contract
(stipulatio), by which the owner ol the land which was to be subjected
to the servitude bound himself to allow its enjoyment, or in default to
pay a penal sum, e. g. ‘per te non fieri neque per heredem tuum, quo·
minus mihi heredique meo ire agere liceat; si adversus ea lactum sit,
tanturn dari' Dig.45. 1. 2. 5. A right thus created could not in itseli

- avail in rem, or ‘run with the land ;' yet it seems clear from Gaius (ii.
31) that in his time such pactiones and stipulationes were as effectual to
create servitudes over provincial soil as in iure cessio and mancipatio
over praedia Italica We must consequently suppose that the praetor had
intervened, and by the introduction of an utilis actio (confessoria) t'or the
protection os the promise against all successors oi the other in title had
given the right a genuine ‘real' character. ln Justinian’s time os course
