ΟΝ THE EARLIER HISTORY OF ROMAN CIVIL
PROCEDURE.

A favourite subject oi speculation with tho political philosophans
of the 17th and18thcenturies was the social condition of man in ⁵
the remote ages anterior to his union with his sellows in the organiza-
tion called the state, and the process by which this latter tirst came

Though the latter os these theories is no less pure speculation than
the former, it cannot be denied that it is largely supported by the

actual evidence afforded us by primitive societies. As by the sossils
