in obligationem deduci nullo modo possunt. Si quis alium3
daturum facturumve quid spoponderit, non obligabitur, veluti
si spondeat Titium quinque aureos daturum. quodsi effecturum
se, ut Titius daret, spoponderit, obligatur. si quis alii, quaml
cuius iuri subiectus sit, stipuletur, nihil agit. plane solutio
etiam in extranei personam conferri potest (veluti si quisita
stipuletur ‘mihi aut Seio dare spondes? ¹), ut obligatio quidem

cium by the stipulator: cs. inf. ‘commercium adipisci stipulator? For the
ground 01 nullity 01 such a condition as ‘si ex libero servus fiat,’ already
stated on§ 1, cf. Dig. 45. 1. 83. 5 ‘ut ne haec quidem stipulatio de
homine libero probanda sit, illum cum servus erit dare spondes? .. . quia
ea duntaxat quae natura sua possibilia sunt deducuntur in obligationem,
... et casum adversamque fortunam spectari hominis liberi neque civile
neque naturale est,' Dig. 50 17. 29 ‘quod initio vitiosum est, non potest
tractu temporis convalescere! A stipulation for conveyance 01 res sua
which the stipulator believed to be aliena was void because ‘id quod
alicuius est ei dari non potest :' to make a man owner (dare) 01 what
was already his own was an absolute impossibility, Gaius iii. 99.

ξ 8. A promise by A that B shall door sorbeat as a rule imposes no
obligation on either A or B ε but

(r) A will be bound (a) 11 his promise is secured by a poena, ξ 21 int,
Dig.45. 1. 38. 2: (b) 11 he promises either expressly (as is said in the
text) or impliedly to getB to do the act: ior the readiness with which
such a promise would be implied cf. Dig. 451. 81. pr. ‘quotiens quis
alium sisti (shall appear in court) promittit nec adicit poenam. . ..
quaeritur an committatur stipulatio: et Celsus ait, etsi non est hnic
stipulationi additum “nisi steterit, poenam dari,'’ in id, quanti interest
sisti, contineri . . nam qui alium sisti promittit, promittit id se acturum,
ut stet!

(2) B will be bound (a) 11 Α is his messenger, intermediary, or agent:
see Excursus IX at the end 01 this Book. 11 Α acts as his negotiorum
gestor (unauthorized agent) and B refuses to ratiiy, A is answerable lor
loss accruing to the promisee only 11 the latter believed him to be
authorized3 (b) 11 he is A's heir: ior this see ξ 13 and notes inf.

Sometimes, however, a person incurred liability under a contract in
which be was not directly a party, and was not even so much as named :
in particular (a) the paterfamilias or dominus on certain contracts oi his
son or slave, Bk. iv. 7 ini.; (b) the principal on contracts made sor him
by his agent, authorized or unauthorized (Cod 4. 26. 7. 1.), and (c) the
pupil on reaching puberty was suable by actio utilis on contracts made
in relation to his affairs by his guardian: ‘si impuberis nomine tutor
vendiderit, evictione secuta Papinianus . . . . ait dari in eum cuius tutela
gesta sit utilem actionem, sed adicit in id demum, quod rationibus eius
accepto latum est' Dig. 21. 2. 4. 1. : cf. Dig. 26. 7. η. 1.
