senate of his resolution to codify the constitutions 31 Constantincl
(a 3. gob-337) and all his successors by means ofa commission of
nine persons: ‘Ad similitudinem Gregoriani atque Hermogeniaui
codicis cunctas colligi constitutiones decernimus, quas Constantinus
inclysus et post eum diti principes nosque tulimus, edictorum viribus
aut sacra generalitate subnixas' (Cod. Theod r. 1. 5). Nothing, how·
eser, was done till nn. 435, when 3 fresh commission of sixteen per·

sons was appointed for the purpose, with power to make alterations
in mditidual constitutions The result was the Theodosian code, pro·
mulgated in February 33 438, with statutory force 13333 and after the
commencement of 33. 439, as the only authority for the ‘ius principale‚‘
or imperial legislation, from Constantine 1 to that date. It consisted
of sixteen books, arranged separately in Titles and rubrics, and the
constitutions in each Title were placed in chronological order. The
first fise books were arranged 33 the plan of the commentaries on the
Edict, and contained most of the enactments relating to private law.
The sisth to the eighth books consist principally of constitutional
and administratis-e ordinanees; the ninth is crimina] law; the tenth
and eleventh relate to the financial system, and in part to procedure;
the twelfth to the fifteenth, to the constitution and administration 31
towns and other corporations, 3ηά the sixteenth contains the consti-
tutions which deal with the church and the ecclesiastical system in
general. This code uas accepted in the West as well 33 in the East,
3ηά partly thus, partly by the ‘law of Citations' of twelve years’ earlier
date, uniformity of law was secured throughout the two halves ol the
empire. Precautions were also taken against subsequent divergence:
the two governments agreed that constitutions which either might
find occasion to make should be communicated by the one to the other,
and subject to revision by mutual consent be published by both legis·
latures; in default of this procedure they should have no universal
validity. In contradistinction to the code, such single enactments
were called novellae leges or 333313 ; 3 number 31 them were issued by
Theodosius 33. 448, and confirmed by t'atenrinian 111 in the West
in the following year. The joint style of enactment was actually
followed till nn. 455, and there are several collections of novels which
belong to this period. From 33. 455 the tie between the two empires
was greatly wealtened though Anthemius (3.3. 467-472) published
inthe West an enactment issued in the East by Leo: formally, how·
ever, the connection was maintained, so that the new constitutions still
bore the names of both emperors, though the place of their issue
or the province of the magistrates to whom they were addressed
