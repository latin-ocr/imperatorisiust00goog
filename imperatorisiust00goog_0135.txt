24. 2. 2. ι. Persons, however, who had been married by confarreatio
could be separated only hya religious form of divorce called diffarreatio.
lt seems uncertain, where manus was produced by usus or coemptio,
whether the wife was as free ‘repudium mittere’ as where she was not in ’
manu mariti, though Gaius says (i. 137) ‘a wife subject to manus can
no more compel her husband to release her therefrom without dissolution
of the marriage than a daughter can compel her father to emancipate
her) Α special form was prescribed for repudia (probably by the lex
Iulia de adulteriis, Β. α 17) which required the message to be delivered
by a freedman of the family, in the presence of seven witnesses above
the age of puberty, and citizens of Rome, Dig. 24. 2. 9.

The recklessness with which the right of divorce was exercised in the
darker days of the Empire is well known. For centuries the only
attempts made to check the evil consisted in imposing certain pro-
prietary disadvantages on persons who unjustifiahly divorced their con·
sorts, or who occasioned a divorce by· their own infidelity. Thus a wife
whose adultery led to her dismissal forfeited a sixth of her dos, and au
eighth for more venial offences ; and if there were children born of the
marriage, the husband might retain for their benefit a sixth of the dos
for each, though the whole amount thus retained might not exceed a
half of the whole dos (‘ retentio propter liberoS,’ Ulpian, reg. 6. u sq.). A
husband who occasioned a divorce had to restore the dos either at once,
or at least before the whole time had elapsed for which, under ordinary
circumstances, he would have been entitled to enjoy it. The acceptante
of Christianity as the State religion brought with it a large amount of
imperial legislation on this subject. On divorce by mutual consent no
restraint was imposed until Justinian (Novels, 117 ιο, and 134 11), as a
penalty forced the parties into the retirement of a religious house. Con-
stantine (Cod. 6. 13.1) enumerated the grounds on which repudiation
should be deemed justifiable, and additions to the list were made by his
successors. The penalties inflicted on the guilty· parties, as fixed by
Honorius, were loss of dos and donatio propter nuptias respectively.
Repudiation without any such good reason was still more severely
punished with enforced retirement to a cloister, and forfeiture of the
whole property in favour partly of the cloister, partly of the guilty person’s
statutory heirs, Nov. ι 34. 11.

A few words are necessary on the proprietary relations of hus-
band and wife lf the latter passed in manum, of course such property
as she had went absolutely with her to the husband ; but if the marriage
was unaccompanied hy manus, and the wife was not in potestas, hei
property remained as completely under her own control, and as free
from that of her husband, as if she had never married at all Yet the
Roman law imposed on the husband the burden of all domestic ex·
penses, and of the rearing of the issue3 audit was doubtless this
inequality which led to the institution of dos, which was a contribution
