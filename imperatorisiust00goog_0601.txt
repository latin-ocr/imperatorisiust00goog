leaving any successor, Dig. 16. 3. 1.14; 46. 3. 95. 1, or has undergone
capitis deminutio maxima, Dig. 2. 8. 5. pr. ; and similarly the answer to
the question, whether a surety, when sued, can defend himself by plead-
ing that his principal has been in integrum restitutus, depends upon the
object for which the creditor obtained the guaranty3 e. g. if the principal
debtor is a minor, and the very obJ'ect for which the creditor took the
surety was to protect himself against his restitutio ‘propter minorem
aetatem,' the surety cannot plead the exceptio: ‘si, curn scirem minorem,
etei fidem non haberem, tu fideiusseris pro eo, non est aequum fideius-
sori subveniri’ Dig. 4. 4. 13. pr.

A surety cannot be deprived of any exceptio to which he has once
acquired a right by any unilateral act of his principal: ‘sed verius est,
semel adquisitam fideiussori pacti exceptionem ulterius ei invito extor-
queri non posse' Dig. 2. 14 62.

Au exceptio in rem is one which can be pleaded against any one who
can sue on a given ground of action: an exceptio in personam is one
which can be advanced only against a determinate person or persons3
e.g. the exceptio doli, and sometimes that based on a pactum deuon
petendo, as where one of two or more correi credendi promises not to
sue the debtor.

'Pin XV. The term interdictum in origin means little more than
edictum. The legis actiones could not be employed for the prevention
of anticipated wrong, or for the punishment of actual breaches of the
peace3 these were matters to be dealt with by the imperium of the
magistrate (consul or praetor), who upon application made would issue
an injunction (interdictum) or order (decretum) disobedience to which,
unless justified, would be punished by imprisonment, fine, or other or-
dinary means at his disposal for enforcing compliance with his command.

The chief purposes for which such interdicta were issued were the
prevention and punishment of offences against loca sacra and publica
(Dig. 43. 1. 2, ib. 7-14), and the protection of Possession as distinct from
Ownership: ‘in legitimis actionibus nemo ex iure Quiritium possessionem
suam vocare audet, sed ad interdictum venit, ut praetor his verbis utatur;
uti nunc possidetis, etc! Festus, s. v. Possessio. Thus some of them fall
within the sphere of public, others within that of private, law ; their chief
characteristic however in this period is, that they are a class of remedies
standing altogether outside and apart from the ordinary method of
redress by legis actio, the procedure of which was inapplicable to them.

Under the formulary system interdicts still continued to be issued in
relation to the same matters, especially possession, as before, but their
