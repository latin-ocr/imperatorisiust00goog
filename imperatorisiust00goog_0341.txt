328 EXCURSUS III.

therefore (all) Possession is equivalent to Equitable ownership‚ is
obvious.

lllr. Hunter seems to have been led into what we cannot hut regard
as other than a completely wrong theory by not rigidly confining his
attention to Possession—not this possession or that possession, but
all Possession-whether bona fide or mala fide. His insurmountable
difficulty lies in the impossibility of identiiying Possession‚ when
accompanied by mala fides, with Equitable ownership. Upon mals
lide Possession he is inconsistent In one passage (p. 205) he says,
‘the interdictu were open equally to mala fide possessors ;' in another
(p. 200), ‘the mala lide possessor oi moveahles had no right against
third persons! The latter statement, which is based solely on the
inability ol a mala lide possessor to bring an actio furti othonorum
vi raptorum, is shown to be untrue, so lar as interdicts are concerned‚
by Savigny and by Dr. Waller (Selecred Titles from the Digest,
Introduction to Digest 4¹· al: and interdicts are all that here we
need concein ourselves with 3 other remedies are not lor the protec-
tion ol Possession at all. ln fact, Mr. Hunteffs general position
seems defensible only to this extent, via. that where a man has usu-
capion Possession‚ he also has Equitable ownership.

For a discussion of the question, to what part of the Roman system
the doctrine of Possession logically belongs, see Poste, Gaius pp.
648 sqq.; and ior the possessory interdicts, and the cases to which
they were individually applicable, Bk. iv. Title 15, and notes inl.
