THE INSTITUTES-SYSTEM OF PRIVATE LAW. 67

fully executed. These bullry worlrs, however (as Justinian himself
observes in Inst. Prooem. 3), were ill-suited for the elementary instruc·
tion of students. Accordingly, as the commentaries of Gaius and the
other books which had long formed the curriculum of the schools had
been deprived oi all force, and their very study forbidden, or at least
discouraged, it was necessary to bring out a new worlr ln lieu of them
Upon this there had been engaged, even during the composition ol
the Digesta small committee consisting of Tribonian, Theophilus,
and Dorotheus, the two latter being professors of law at Constanti·
nople and Berytus respectively, and already members of the Digest
commission. The boolr which they produced was called ‘Institu-
tions of Justinian,’ though in England it is better lrnown as ‘the Insti-
tutes ;' in form, and to a great extent also in substance, it was founded
on the commentaries of Gaius, but also contained large extracts from
the ‘res quotidianae' of the same writer, as well as from the ‘Institu-
tiones' of other jurists (e. g. Ulpian, Marcian, and Florentinus); finally,
by apt references to the Code, it was so ‘brought up' to the present
date as to give the student a general conspectus of the rules of private
law then binding.

It will here perhaps not be unprofitable to inquire briefly, from the
point of view of general jurisprudence, what is the field and what the
subject-matter of private as distinguished from public law; and in
pursuing this inquiry the method and terminology of Savigny seem
preferable to those of the English analytical school of jurists, not only
because the student, if not already familiar with the latter, can easily
become so by reference to standard worlrs¹, but also because a con·
sideration of the German arrangement will enable him to understand
more fully the logical completeness and the interconnection of the
parts of the Roman system. Savigny represents jurisprudence as the
science of legal relations, anda legal relation is a relation between
person and person defined and determined by a rule of law: this
determination bys rule of law consisting in the assignment of asphere
or province to the individual will, in which it is supreme and inde·
pendent of every other will. Private law then will be the aggregate
of those positive rules which detine and determine the relations be·
tween men in their private capacity, and its subject-matter will be
fully discovered by ascertaining the possible kinds of legal relations.
This is done by reverting to the effect of a rule of law on the relation
between man and man; that is to say, by considering the objecta on

¹ Especially Austin’s Lectores, and Holland's jurisprudence.
