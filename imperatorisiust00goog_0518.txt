Furti autem actio ei competit, cuius interest rem salvam 13
esse, licet dominus non sit: itaque nec domino aliter competit,
quarn si eius intersit rem non perire. Unde constat creditorem 14
de pignore subrepto furti agere posse, etiamsi idoneum de·
bitorem habeat, quia expedit ei pignori potius incumbere quam
in personam agere: adeo quidem ut, quamvis ipse debitor
eam rem subripuerit, nihilo minus creditori competit actio
surti. Item si fullo polienda curandave aut sarcinator sar· 15
cienda vestimenta mercede certa acceperit eaque furto amiserit,
ipse furti habet actionem, non dominus, quia domini nihil
interest eam rem non perire, cum iudicio locati a fullone aut
sarcinatore rem suam persequi potest. sed et bonae fidei
emptori subrepta re quam emerit, quamvis dominus non sit,
omnimodo competit lurti actio, quemadmodum et creditori.
lulloni vero et sarcinatori non aliter iurti competere placuit,
quam si solvendo sint, hoc est si domino rei aestimationem
solvere possint: namsi solvendo non sunt, tunc quia ab eis

the pater the filius, even aster he had lest his power, Tit. 8. 6 int'.: but
the offender could be punished at once by invoking the aid oi the praetor
is the theit was serious, Dig. 48. 19. 11. 1.

ξ 18. The object ol the actio surti was the recovery oi the poena dupli
or quadrupli fixed by law. Τ11ε rule as to who could bring it is simi·
larly laid down by Gaius iii. 203, and Paulus; ‘furti actione is agere potest,
cuius interest rem non periisse ' sent rec 2. 31. 4 All of these statements,
however, are somewhat too wide: ‘neque . . . . cuiuscunque intererit,
rem non perire, habet furti actionem’ Dig. 47. 2. 1410: the action lay at
the suit only ot' the owner, bona fide possessor, or person who had
detention ol or some real right (e. g. usufruct, hypotheca) in the stolen
property less than ownership, and then only if he was prejudiced by the
theft. Hence the vendee before delivery was debarred from suing in his
oum name, Dig. 47. a 14. pr.: ib. 80. pr, as also was the depositary
under ordinary circumstances, §17inf, and all others who had merely
rights in personam in respect oi the property stolen, eg. the promisee in
a stipulation, Dig. 18. r. 35. 4.

ξ 14. lt seems at one time to have been doubtful whether the pledgec
ought to be allowed to bring actio furti ii the pledgor was solvent
(idoneus) ; ‘sed utrum semper creditoris interest, an ita demum, si debitor
solvendo non est? et putat Pomponius semper eius interesse pignus
habere, quod et Papinianus. . . probat' Dig. 47. 2. 12. 2. Papinian even
thought that if two things were pledged sor oue debt, and one of them
was stolen, the pledgee ought to be allowed actio furti even ii the other
alone was adequate security, Dig. ib. 14 5.

i 15. The clothes are at the risk os the fullo or sarcinator, Dig. 47. 14.
