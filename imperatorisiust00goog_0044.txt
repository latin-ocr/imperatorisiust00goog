THE anrcr. , 31

which the praetor Atilius (nc. ar 3) directed against the encroachments
of strange religions, though a ‘law,’ was yet an edictum repentinum.

It also became usual lor each successive praetor to adopt, in sub-
stance, the edict ol his predecessor, with such additions, abrogations‚
and changes as he deemed expedient. Such partos his edict as a
praetor derived lrom that ol his predecessor in office was called
edictum tralaticium. lt was owing to this lact that, though the edict
ol each individual praetor had such an ephemeral validity, the prae·
torian law was at once so stable and yet so elastic. By the constant
accretion os new rules which legal development and increasing com·
mercial activity required, the edict assumed the lorm ol a permanent
body ol law, which had the advantage ol the ius civile in the ease
with which it could be repealed, altered, or extendcd, and which,
therefore, apart lrom other consideratione, recommended itsell as a
mode ol legislation in many ways preferable to that ol the comitia.
The danger of entrustlng to the caprice ol a single indiuidual so .
large a power ol altering the law will strike every reader3 but it had
two very efficient saleguards. One ol these was a strong public and
professional opiniont the other was the short duration ol the praetor's
office. If one praetor ventured on innovations which were not
approved hythe people or the lawyer clasS, his successor could easily
remove his obnoxious additions from the edict, fora year they would
be binding, but beyond that they had not necessarily any validity.
In point ol lact, it would seem that each praetor framed his edict
alter carelul consultation with his friends learned in the law, and that
changes were but rarely introduced lor which public opinion was not
ready; the lact, already noticed, that each praetor always accepted a
very large portion ol the edict ol his predecessor, a portion, indeed,
which every year grew comparatively larger, as every year made the
edict more complete, proves that the Roman praetors, as a class,
were the best ol conservatives. Cicero accuses Verres ol having
issued ‘edicta nova in re vetere,’ and altered rules lor which the con·
stant acceptance of his predecessore had won the confidence and
affection ol the people; but we may believe that Verres had lew
imitatore, and that, as a general rule, both parts ol the edictum per·
petuam—the part which was old and the part which was new-were
alike viewed with approval by the mass ol the people. Though,

however, lew were guilty ol Verres' breach ol laith, who, according ’

to Cicero (in Verr. i. 46), in his judicial administration sometimes
followed a course the very opposite ol that which in his edict he had
deliberately stated he intended to take, it seems that in the last cen-
