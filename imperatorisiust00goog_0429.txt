practica} incapacity of women to enter into contracts of this kind as
promisors. lt seems to have originated in edicts of Augustus and
Claudius, prohibiting wives from-becoming sureties for their husbands,
Dig. 16. 1. 2. pr. lt is supposed, with considerable probability, that the
cause of the more general enactment, the SC. Velleianum,1t.n.64, was
recklessness with which women, after Claudius had abolished the tutela
legitima of agnates over them (p. 140 supr), exercised their newly·found
control of their property on behalf of others. This enacted that no action
should lie on contracts of suretyship entered into by women as promisors ς
‘quod ad fideiussiones et mutui dationes pro aliis pro quibus interces·
serint feminae pertinet, tametsi ante videtur ita ius dictum esse, ne eo
nomine ab his petitio neve in eas actio detur, cum eas virilibus officiis
fungi et eius generis obligationibus obstringi non sit aequum; arbitrari
senatum, recte atque ordine facturos ad quos de ea re in iure aditum erit,
si dederint operam ut in ea re senatus voluntas servetur’ Dig. 16. 1. 2.
The senatusconsult thus related only to fideiussio and mutuum ς but its
principle was extended to all forms of intercessio, privative as well as
cumulative, by responsa of the jurists and imperial enactments, Dig.
loc. cit. 1. pr.. ib. 2. 4. Though it had refused a remedy on such con·
tracts, it would seem that the usual practice was for the praetor to grant
the action, if applied for, which could then be met by the exceptio SC¹.
Velleiani, frequently mentioned in the texts, which could be pleaded
against execution even after judgment had been given, Dig. 14. 6. 11. It
must not, however, be inferred from this that the woman incurred even a
‘natural’ obligation to pay the debt; for if she pald in ignorance of her
right to the exceptio, she could recover by condictio indebiti, Dig. 12. ά
4o pr. Another view as to the history of the matter, in some degree
supported by the terms of the senatusconsult, is that women had been
forbidden to become sureties even by the old civil law, and that the
enactments of the time of Augustus and Claudius are merely evidence of
its evasion through the rapid decay of old Roman manners at the close
of the Republic.

There are a number of exceptions from the operation of the senatus·
consult, as e. g. where the woman had been guilty of dolus towards the
creditor, Dig. 16. 1. 2. 3, and where the latter, through no fault of his own,
was not aware that the person ‘interceding’ was a woman, ib. 12; where
the intercessio was made for valuable consideration, Cod. 4. 29 23. pr. ς
where the debt for which she interceded was practically her own; and
where the creditor was a minor and the principal debtor insolvent, Dig. 4.
4. 12.
