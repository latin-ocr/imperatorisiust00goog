The latest and most rehned form of pledge is hypotheca, in which
· there was no conveyance ol either ownersbip or possession ; it was
effected bya bare sormless agreement between the debtor and creditor,
that certain speeifie pmperty ol the former should be liable in lull
sor his debt to the latter, who should be entitled to sell in deiault oi

payment within a prescribed time: ‘contrahitur hypotheca per paetum
conventum, cum quis paciscatur, ut res eius propter aliquam obliga·
tionem sint hypothecae nomine obligatae: nec ad rem pertinet¹
quibus fit verbis' Dig. ao. 1. 4. Such an agreement, in itself, was
inoperative to create rights either real or personal: it was, however,

enlorced by the praetor, who treated the right of sale as a ius in re
aliena, of which the creditor could not be deprived by any subsequent
aet oi the debtor, and which he could successiully assert (by remedies
of his own introductionl against any other person whatsoever, whether
the creditor, his successor, alienee, or trustee in bankmptcy. The
steps by which this praetorian innovatlon reached its futt development
arc these. It was first introduced in the joint interest os landlord
and tenant ianner, in order to enable the latter to pledge his sarming
stock as security lor his rent, a purpose lor which pignus was not
conveniently applicable: subsequently it came to be recognised as a
universal mode ol pledge, ol use between debtors and creditors oi
every kind, though the rights ol the latter, in cases other than that oi
landlord and tenant, were protected by remedies differing slightly in
form and name srom those then employed: ior these, and the relation
between them, reference should be made to Bk. iv. 6. 7, ib. 15.3 ini,
and the notes on both passages.

Hypotheca possessed great advantages over the earlier forms oi
pledge, of which fiducia was quite obsolete in the time oi Justinian
The pledgor was never deprived ol the use and possessiones his
property, and yet the creditor was absolutely secured. The class oi
pledgable objeets was largely augmented: money could now be lent
on the security oi things not yet in existence, eg. future crops and
expectations l‘et quae nondum sunt, lutura tamen sunt, hypothecae

possible to create a general mortgage, which was done by statute in
