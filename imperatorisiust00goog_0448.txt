DE MANDATO.

Mandatum contrahitur quinque modis, sive sua tantum
gratia aliquis tibi mandet, sive sua et tua, sive aliena tantum,
sive sua et aliena, sive tua et aliena. at si tua tanturn gratia
tibi mandatum sit, supervacuum est mandatum et ob id nulla

(a) lt the partner who actually makes the contract was instructed to
do so by the rest-ie. is their agent—they are each liable insolidum:
‘sed si plures exerceant, unum autern de numero suo magistrum fecerint,
huius nomine in solidum poterunt conveniri ;' nor could they claim the
beneficium divisionis, ‘ue in plures adversarios distringatur qui curn uno
contraxerit ;' one who paid of course had regressus, Dig. 14 3. ¹3· 2;
ib. 14

(b) ls he is not their express agent t‘or the purpose, the actually con·-
tracting partner alone incurs liability, even though the transactionis
entered into on behalfof the firm, unless (1) the rest subsequently ratily
it, whereby they become as liable as ii it had been authorized by thern
from the first, and (a) except and so far as the firm has been benefited
by the contract: ‘iure societatis per socium aere alieno socius nou obli-
gatur, nisi in communem arcam pecuniae versae suut’ Dig. 17. 2. 82.
Thus in Roman law socii have no implied authority to bind one another
even upon transactions which form their ordinary business.

(c) If he makes the contract in his own name, the rest incur no
liabilities even though it results in a benefit to thern.

vu„ XXVI. The contract os mandatum produces efi'ects os two dis-
serent kinds; first, an obligation between the principal (mandator,
dominus) and the agent (mandatarius, procurator3 the first term is not
classical), which is discussed fully iu this Title; and second, the relation
of representation; this subject, which regards the rights and duties
that arise immediately for the principal from the contracts made by
his agent on his behalf, is discussed in Excursus IX at the end ol
this Book.

The scope os the agent’s commission might be general as well as special,
and so might extend to the management oi a person's entire affairs; but
it might not be altogether indefinite, Dig. 17. 1. 48. 2, unlawlul, or im·
moral, ξ 7 int, and it must relate only to future acts: ‘si post creditam
pecuniam mandavero creditori credendam, nullum esse mandatum rec·
tissime Papinianus ait' Dig. 17. 1. 12. 14.

Justinian’s five species os mandatum are taken from the res quotidianae
oi Gaius (Dig. 17. 1. 2. 1-6), where, as bere, the possible case is omitted
of a commission being given by A to B to lend money to C, in order to
enable the latter to pay a debt owing to himself, which is in the interest
oi all three (sua, tua, et aliena). Supervacuum is here used to mean
‘void ι’ cf. inutilis in Tit. 19 supr.
