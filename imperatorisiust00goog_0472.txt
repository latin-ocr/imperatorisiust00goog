ORIGIN ΛΝΒ DEVELOPMENT OF BON. POSSESSIO. 459

possessio obtained under a praetorian will; in other words, the latter
was sirie re

Savigny connects the praetorian system ol' succession, in origin,
with the old usucapio pro herede (Gaius ii. 52-56) which the civil
law regarded with approval (⁴ quod voluerunt veteres maturius heredi·
tates adiri, ut essent qui sacra iacerent, quorum illis temporibus
summa observatio luit, et ut creditores haberent, a quo suum con·
sequerentur’ ib. 55) and ol which the praetor laid hold as the starting-
point oi his innovations; he gave the possession to certain persons
who, it was admitted, had an equitable, though not a legal, right to the
estate, and devised, iu the interdict quorum bonorum, a remedy by
which they could recover the deceased's property irom other pos·

- sessors, thus placing them in a position to become owners by usu· ·

mpio; the practical assimilation oi the bonorum possessor to the
heres, and the introduction ol the possessoria hereditatis petitio,
being due to the identification os bona fide possession with boni-
tarian ownership. Others (e. g. Hugo) think bonorum possessio was
based, in all essential points, on the ius gentium, and was in origin
the system applied in the succession to aliens by the praetor pere-
grinus, from whose edict it was gradually transferred to the edictum
urbanum. This, though α priori an attractive theory, seems untenable
on account of the tenderness which the praetor almost ostentatiously
showed ior the civil law and the agnatic conception ol ltinship3 a
gentile system oi inheritance would have been based solely on cogna-
tion. Niebuhr connects bonorum possessio with the possessio ol ager
publicus (p. 32⁶ suph), with the suecession to which alone he thinks
it was originally concemed,· but this, as has been remarked, is
irreconcileable with the very name bonorum possessio, and improbable
on general grounds.
