IN'TRODUCTION TO BOOK I.

Trrr first two Titles ol this book are merely introductory, and afford
no clue to the principle on which it is intended to distribute the rules
ol the private code. Title 1 is derived in the inain lrorn the ‘institu-
tions’ of Ulpian; it contains definitions of Justice and jurisprudence,
determines the scope ol the worlr aa a treatise on private law, and
draws the distinction between ius naturale, gentium, and civile, which
hasbeen adverted to in the general Introduction (p. 27 sq, supr). In
the second Title ius naturale is defined alter Ulpian, and then ius civile
and ius gentium are distinguished in the words ol Gaius, though, as
has been pointed out elsewhere, tbe latter contrast is the true and
important one, and in other parts ol the work ius gentium and ius
naturale are identified. The sources ol the positive law of Rome are
then specified and each briefly described.

ln the opening words ol the third Title we meet with the significant
statement of the principle upon which tbe arrangement ol the Insti-
tutes is to proceed. That principle, and, accordingly, that arrange·
ment, is taken literally lrom Gaius, and an exposition of its meaning
will be as important lor the work os the jurist as sor that ol the prince.
‘The whole law by which we are govemed relates either to persons,
or to things, orto actions' The division ol the Institutes into these
three departments is perlectly clear; the ‘ius quod ad personas
pertinet’ occupies Bk. i. Title 3, to the end; the ‘ius quod ad res'
extends from the beginning ol Bk. ii to Bk. iv. Title 53 the remainder,

ol Bk. iv ‘pertinet ad actiones! In this particular point the Gaian ·

distribution is more satisfactory, as it makes the break between res
and actiones at the end ol the third commentary, and devotes the
whole of the fourth to the latter subject, in the Institutes the formal
division of Rooks tends somewhat to obscure the material classilica·
tion of the system. This, however, though ‘inelegans' presents no
obstacle to our comprehension os the system itsell3 but we are at
once met by difficulties, and by great differences of opinion among
the commentators, when we attempt to discover the meaning ol the
