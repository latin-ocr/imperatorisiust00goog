there was no rule οἰ law providing that rights oi action should be barred '
unless issue were joined within a definite period from their accrual.

The praetor, however, provided that many οἰ the new actions which
he introduced through the edict should lie only within an annus utilis
irom the moment at which they first accrued, though between this period
and his own limited tenure of office there does not seem to have been the
connection suggested by Justinian in the text. By sar the most irn-
portant class oi these annales actiones are the praetorian penal actions,
with the exception of that on lurtum manifestum, which remained per·
petua because it was in commutation of a capital penalty, Gaius iv. 111 3
iii. 189, but even these were perpetuae so iar as they were brought only
to deprive the delinquent oi any benefit' he had derived from his wrong :
‘in honorariis actionibus sic esse deliniendum Cassius ait, ut quae rei
persecutionem habeant, hae etiam post annum darentur, ceterae intra
annum' Dig. 44 7. 35. pr. Praetorian actions which were merely uni·
laterally penal (e. g. actio doli) were prescribed in a year ii contra ius
civile, Dig. ib. Interdicis, so far as they were penal, were similarly
limited: the actiones populares were all annales, Dig. 47. 23. 8: and
the prescription of the aedilician actions on sale has been already noticed,
p. 423 supr, as also has the longi temporis praescriptio relating to actions
ior the recovery of property which had been sor a defined time in the hands
ol a bona fide possessor with iustus titulus, p. ²¹7 supr. ln course oi time
too a prescription was lixed by disconnected legislation lor other actions, in
particular one oi live years for the querella inofficiosi testamenti, Cod 3.
28. 36. 2. Actions which fell under the old rule were called perpetuae,
those which were limited by any of these periods temporales.

More systematic legislation upon this matter commenced with Con-
stantine, who enacted that all real actions which were not already limited
might be repelled by an exceptio unlessbrought within forty years, Cod.
7. 39. 2, which subsequently seems to have been reduced to thirty, the
time here being not utile but continuum. ln nn. 424 Theodosius sub-
jected to this same thirty years’ limit all actions whatsoever, with a few
exceptions, which had hitherto been perpetuae, Cod. ib. 3. This rule is
in force under Justinian, the only actions oi importance which are not
governed by it being vindicatio in libertatem, Cod. 7. 22. 3, and fiscal
claims for unpaid taxes, Cod. 7. 39. 6, which continued perpetual in the
old sense; so that in his compilations actio perpetua means an action
which is prescribed in not less than thirty years.

For the remedies oi the bonorum possessor and other praetorian suc·
cessors who leigned themselves heirs see Gaius iv. 34, 35. ·
