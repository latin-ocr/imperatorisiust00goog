liberi of their maternal grandparents or paternal grandfather, etc, in lieu
of their mother, father, etc, their portion, however, being diminished by

the deceased was a filiusfamilias with peculium oran emancipatus. In

derived.

For the earlier law relating to peculium castrense see on Bk. ito pr.

eorum iure communi pertinebit :' cf. Cod. 6. 61. 3 and 4), who took the
peculium only if there were none to precede him. The same rules
governed the succession to peculium quasi castrense.
