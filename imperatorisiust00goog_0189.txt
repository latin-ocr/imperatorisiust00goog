176 INTRODUCTION TO BOOK II.

system is concerned, the only divisions 01 res which are 01 primary
importance are, first, that into res corporales and incorporales, and,
second, that into res singulae and universitates. Res corporales hav-
ing been defined (G. ii. 13, Inst. ii. 2. 1) as tangihle objects, and such
tangible objects as cannot be in singulorum dominio having already
been excluded, the modes in which ownership (and incidentally pos·
session) 01 thern can be acquired, natural (Tit. ι) and civil (Tito.
and 7), are explained. Res incorporales having been defined (G. ii.
14, lnst ii. ι. a), the nature 01 some 01 thern (viz. servitudes) and
their modes 01 acquisition are described in Tities 3-5: others, viz.
obligations, occupy the greater portion 01 the third Book. These are
all res singulae: universitates and their modes 01 vesting are examined
under the heads 01 hereditas, whether testamentary (ii. 10-25) or
intestate (iii. 1-9), adrogation (iii. ιο), and bonorum addictio libertatis
causa (iii. ιι).

Speaking briefly, then, the ios quod ad res pertinet, extending over
the whole 01 the second and third Books and part 01 the fourth Book
01 the Institutes, treats 01 tangihle external objects 01 property, with
their titles; real rights over them 01 less orbit than dominium3 inherit·
ance, comprising the subject 01 legacies: two less considerable forms
01 universal succession; and tinally obligations, under the two heads 01
contracts and delicts or torts. All these are ‘res ;' the question still
remains, What is the common property in virtue 01 which they are
classed together, and the law relating to them set apart as one 01 the
three great departments 01 the private code? To this question Mr.

Poste (Gaios p. 159), following hostin, answers that the law relating
to res is set apart because it is the law 01 equal rights. By this he

appears to mean, that in it all persons are regarded as equatio the
sense that exactly the same capacity 01 right and 01 disposition is
ascribed to all, and that differences in such capacity are leit out 01
sight, as belonging properly to the law 01 Persons or unequal rights.
11 this is his meaning, we cannot but reject it as entirely misleading.
The division 01 law into law 01 equal and law 01 unequal rights is no
older than Austin, and to attribute an acquaintance with it to Gaius is
a mere anachronism. Ifby the ius quod ad res pertinet Gaius had
meant to express the law 01 equal rights, he would not, in it, have
noticed incapacities 01 disposition (as he does in ii. 47. 80 sq: 01. Inst.
ii. 8. a), incapacities 01 right (as he does in ii. 87 sq: 01. Inst. ii. 9. 1
and a), disabilities in certain classes to take benefits ola particular
kind (as he does in ii. ιιι) οι exceptions from the ordinary rules for
the execution 01 testaments (ii. 109,Inst.ii.11): it would be super·
