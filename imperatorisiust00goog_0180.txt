Tit. 25.] DE EXCUSATIONIBUS. 167

excusare. Item si quis status controversiam a pupillorum 12
patre passus est, excusatur a tutela. Item maior septuaginta 13
annis a tutela vel cura se potest excusare. minores autem
viginti et quinque annis olim quidem excusabantur: a nostra
autem constitutione prohibentur ad tutelam vel curam aspi·
rare, adeo ut nec excusatione opus fiat qua constitutione
cavetur, ut nec pupillus ad legitimam tutelam vocetur nec
adultus: cum erat incivile eos, qui alieno auxilio in rebus suis
administrandis egere noscuntur et sub aliis reguntur, aliorum
tutelam vel curam subire. Idem et in milite observandum 14
est, ut nec volens ad tutelae munus admittatur. Item Romae 15

ᾗ 12. A suit relating to a person’s status (status controversia) might be
undertaken on political grounds (quaestio de civitate) by reason of the
public rights which citizenship conferred: more often it arose through
the connection between it and some private right, to enjoy which the
civitas of some individual was asserted or denied. In this case the con·
troversia was usually made up into an independent issue in the form of
a praeiudicium, though in effect only incidental to another (and the main)
question. Thus (e. g.) the validity of a will might be disputed on the
ground that the testator was no civis. Sometimes the status controversia
was in reality, as well as in show, an independent suit, undertaken to
establish dominium over a slave, or potestas over a filiusfamilias; and
here the person whose status was in question could not appear person·
ally, but must be represented (as eg. the slave by an adsertor liber·
tatis). Another not uncommon subject of this lrind of suit was free

Δ birth, ingenuitas.

ξ 13. lf, before Justinian's enactment (Cod 5. 30. 5), a minor became
tutor (e. g. legitimus or testamento) he was not disqualified, but a tutor
praetorius was put in until he came of age, Dig. 27. 3. 9. 1. The result
of his law (nemo in tutelam vocetur, antequam quintum et vicesimum
suae aetatis annum impleat) was that, if the nearest agnate was a
minor, he was completely passed over in favour of the next legitimus
who was of age. Yet if a minor were appointed by will a tutor dativus
was still nominated ad interim, as is clear from Tit. 4. 2 supr, and Dig.
26. 2. 32· 2.

5 14. Soldiers on actual service, i. e. before discharge, were absolutely
disabled from being tutors or curators, Cod. 5. 34 4 lf honourably dis-
charged at the end of the full term of service (twenty years) they were
permanently entitled to exemption, except from the tutela or cura of
children of soldiers, as to whom their excusatio lasted one year only. In
case of honourable discharge after less than five years' service no exemp·
tion was allowed : after five years they were excused for one year, after
eight for two, after twelve for three, and aller sixteen for four, Dig. 27.
