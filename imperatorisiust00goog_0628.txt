EARLIER HISTORl' OF ROMAN CIVIL PROCEDURE. 615

the establishment of a regular judicature3 the injured person, with
his kinsmen or dependents‚ made a foray against the wrongdoer, and
swept away his cattle, and with thern, perhaps, his wife and children,
or he threatened him with supematural penalties by ‘fasting' upon
him, as in the East even at the present day; or, finally, 110 reduced
his adversary to servitude, or took his life. The idea of such a
procedure was not compensation, but punishment ; self-redrcss existed
not so much rei, as poenae persequendae causa¹: and as there is
no objective standard of right and wrong, the measure of the injury,
and therefore of the punishment, is the feeling of the injured person.
Traces of this linger on in Roman Law throughout its whole history.
It has been observed² that in settling the damages to be awarded the
earliest administrators of justice took as their guide the measure of
vengeanee likely to be exacted by an aggrieved person under the
circumstances of the case³, and that this is the true explanation oi
the very different penalties imposed by ancient law on offenders
caught in the 301,οῐ soon after it, and on offenders detected after
considerable delay. Even the 13101 Roman law permitted the husband

guished the guilt of the thief according as he was caught in the act
or not ; the fur nocturnus was liable to the same penalty as 1110 adul·
terer: for certain bodily injuries (Gaius iii. 223) the Mosaic law of
retaliation had its counterpart at Rome. And from the ‘addictio'
of the fur manifestus 3ηά 1110 insolvent debtor, and the commonness

less than in private relations, lhering conjectures that a form of self-
redress especially favoured by usage was the seizure and detention

or had earned by the sweat of his brow his own liberation.

From a comparison of the different communities in which we know
11113 system of sels-redress to have prevailed, or even to obtain at the
present day, it would seem that there are two alternative connecting
liuks, as it were, between it and the later remedial process of advanc·
