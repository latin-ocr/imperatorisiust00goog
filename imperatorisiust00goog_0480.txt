debet’ eod.a.17.4), and is not prejudiced if (before notice) he
allows the creditor to set the claim off against a converse one of his
own. Opinione differ as to the necessity of express notice by the
assignee himself. Many writers add that successive and competing
assignees rank, as against the debtor, in the order, not of the assign·
ments, but of the notice; but this is denied by others, and seems to
be unsupported by textual authority.

(a) After notice the debtor is no longer entitled to treat the
assignor in any way as his creditor, and, if sued by him, is protected
by exceptio, Dig. a. ¹4· 6.

(3) The right pasees to the assignee with all the defects and all the
advantages incident to it while vested in the original creditor. So
far as the former are concerned, this may be expressed by saying that
the assignment takes place ‘subject to equities,' Cod. 4. 39. 8, i.e.
the assignee can be met by the same defences as might have been
urged against the original creditor at any moment before notice of
the assignment was received, except such as are purely personal (e. g. ’
the exceptio pacti de non petendo, if available only against the
releasorl. Among the advantages incident to the chose in action

which pass with it are rights of security, both real and personal, and .

unsatisfied claims to interest; the assignee may deal with it as if he
himself had been creditor ab initio; eg. he may assign it afresh,
release it, or use it as a setoff.

(4) In respect of certain assignments for valuable consideration,
there is an important enactment of Anastasius (lex Anastasiana, Cod.
4. 35. aa), to the effect that no purchaser of a chose in action should
be able to recover more from the debtor than what he had paid him·
self, with ordinary interest, even though it was alleged that tlre
transaction was in part a gift. So faras the actual debt exceeded the
purchase money, it was ipso facto cancelled.

The Romans did not carry their theory of assignment beyond the
actio utilis; for although it is true that the assignee's right to sue was
often, and perhaps usually, attested by a cautio or bond of the debtor,
transferred by the assignor for evidentiary purposes, yet this cautio
was no embodiment of the right after the fashion of negotiable in·
strumenta in modern law, which are exempt from the rules relating to
notice and equities. As Mr. Poste remarks (Gaius p. 4 31), ‘the com-
plete transferability of obligations was unknown to jurispmdence
until modern legislation gave validity to contracts with an incerta
personale. with a person unascemained except as a member ofa
