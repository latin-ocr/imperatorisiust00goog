Under Constantine (3.0. god—337) the constitution lost its 1331 sem-
blance 01 republican form, and assumed the character 01 an open
despotism. The most important results 01 11113 were 3 more rigid
concentration 01 311 executive authority, separation 01 the civil and
military administrations, which had luitberto existed in close com·
bination, and the institution 01 3 graduated official hiernrchy, with a
consequent division 01 ranks and dignities. The distinctions 01 con·
dition rest either on an independent foundation oron the simple will
01 the emperor. 01 the first kind are the old contrasts between cives,
Latini, and peregrini, between ingenui and libertini, and between men
01 unblemisbed civil reputation and iniames; also a new one be·
tween proprietors and non-proprietors oi land. 01 the second kind ’
are the patriciate, 3 new distinction devised by the emperors as a
reward ior faithful service in the state or in the field, and the other
dignities 01 the court and 01 1113 civil and military administration,
dignitates palatinae, civiles, militares. All 01 these were arranged in

by their internal discorde and the wealtness 01 their efforts to sup·
press other pretenders to. the throne, paved the way to the final
division 01 1113 empire into West 3ηά Ε331, which toolt place under
Arcadius and Honorius, 3. 0. 395. For some generations the two
empires subsisted side by side with one another. From the com-
mencement 01 the stlth century, however, the Germanic peoples began
to intrude themselves into the dominions- 01 the Western Emperor,
and their aggressione became year by year more menacing, until,
after having long been a mere object 01 booty to the barbatiane, the
Westem empire was finally absorbed in their conquests no. 476.
