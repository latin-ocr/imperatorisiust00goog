18 INTRODUCTION.

mancipi, we know that lor many centuries a slave could not be
effectually enfranchised except by a public act; that the earliest forms
oi wills were dispositions sanctioned either by direct legislative au·
thority oi the populus or by its representatives‚ the seven witnesses
oi the mancipation5 and that the earliest mode in which a binding
contract could be concluded was possibly the so-called nexum, which
in all essential features was identieal with mancipation. Thus the
authority oi the populus-the sanction os public law-was required
to validate almost every dealing between man and man, whether it
was a marriage, a sale, a eontract, the manumission of a slave, the
emancipation ofa sorr, ora testamentary disposition.

The prominent influence os the plebeian elementor the state in the
development oi private law has been already alluded to as a fact
which by itsell appears beyond question. The theory now under
discussion has the meritos explaining this lact, and os carrying the
history os the evolution of private law even further backwards. Suits
in which religious considerations or a religious sanction were involved
were submitted ior decision to the pontifices, presided over by the
king as pontifex maximum and it is represented that religion occu·
pied so large a sphere in the lise of early Rome that the whole oi the
original law may be regarded as partly ius publicum, partly ius
sacrum. What was subsequently known as ‘ius privatum’ attained
agradual recognition and advanced by timid steps to independence
under the protecting aegis ol ius sacrum: ‘ius sacrum was the form
which private law at first assumed, and in which it first received an
independent though subordinate existence, as against the absorbing
and preponderating weight ol ius publicum! But the plebs, when it
became an integral partos the Roman state, was free from all pre-
judices based on the history oi the populus ; and ‘it was in the plebs
that the ius Quiritium, the private portion oi the code, received its full
development, and irorn the plebs that Rome got an idea which
perhaps otherwise she would never have got—the idea ol a private
person! The relations of a private person must be govemed by
private law, and thus it is to the plebeian element in the state that the
main institutions oi private law are to be ascribed. Some os these
developments—the new forms of marriage and of adoption—have

been already suggested. But the plebs consisted ol persons who
were no partos the populus ; exactly then as the members oi the
latter (who had now come to be called patricians) could only possess
and enjoy land, but not own it, so the members oi the former,
precisely because they were not of the populus, could only, it they
