326 EXCURSUS III. '

As to loss 31 Ρ3333331311· through agents, it should be observed,
(1) Τ1131 mere intention 31 the principal no longer to possess is
sufficient; Detention may remain, but one 31 the elements 31 Pos-
v session, animus, has ceased to exist (3) 03 1113 other hand, it,
though the principa] no longer has Detention, his representative has,
the Possession is not terminated: ‘si quis rne vi deiecerit, meos 3311
deiecerit . . ..per eos retineo· possessionem’ Dig. ⁴³· 16. 1. 451 noris
it lost even by cessation 31 the representative’s Detention unless De·
tention becomes physically impossible, or Possession is assumed by
some one else. (3) For the representative to convert his own De·
tention into Possession, there must be either traditio brevi manu
(contrarius animus 33 the part oi the principali, or (Dig. 41. 3.
3. 18) sorne contrectatio on the other's part amounting to lurtum.
(4) llli'sdealing hythe agent (ie. conveyance or abandonment) does
not terminate the Possession unless another party directly assumes it.
(5) hlere termination 31 the relation 31 principal and agent does
not, in itseli, extinguish the Possession, Dig. 41. 3. 383 ib. 25. r 3
ib.4o. 1.

Α question which has been much discussed is why Possession, apart
113111 bona fides and title, came to be treated 33 3 right, and protected
by legal remedies. To this Savigny answers, that the violation 31
Ρ333333133, being in itsels no wrong, can originally have been 13
dressed only because 11 went hand in hand with some violation oi an
actual right, and that lull justice could not have been done in the
matter 31 11113 131131 violation, unless at the same time the Possession
were protected. All the possessory interdius, he says, presuppose
some wrongsul act. In cases 31 violent dispossession this is obvious ;
but even where there is no violence the idea is the same; e.g. in the
application 31 the interdict de precario there is the wrongful 331 31
abusing another person's good nature: 31 Holland’sJurisprudence,
p. 130. On the historical question, in what connection the necessity
ol legal protection was first felt, Savigny adopts the theory 31 Niebuhr,
that possessory interdicts were originally devised in order to guard
the interest 31 thc individual citizen 111 1113 ager publicus, which the
State permitted him to occupy and enjoy, and were subsequently
extended to the Possession 31 private property, moveable and irn-
moveable. ln support 31 this it is pointed out that possessio and

- possidere are very uniformly used to technically denote this kind 31

occupatiori, and that 1113 interdicte recuperandae possessionis relate
only to immoveables; other arguments are derived from the known
laets 31 precarium and emphyteusis (savigny, Possession 1 12⁸). Α
