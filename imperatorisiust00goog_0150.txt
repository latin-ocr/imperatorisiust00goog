Titia] QUIBUS MODIS IUS POTESTATIS SOLVITUR. 137

hoc in melius per constitutionem reformavit, ut fictione pristina
explosa recta via apud competentes iudices vel magistratus
parentes intrent et filios suos vel filias vel nepotes vel neptes
ac deinceps sua manu dimitterent. et tunc ex edicto praetoris
in huius filii vel filiae, nepotis vel neptis bonis, qui vel quae a
parente manumissus vel manumissa fuerit, eadem iura prae·
stantur parenti, quae tribuuntur patrono in bonis liberti: et
praeterea si impubes sit tilius vel lilia vel ceteri, ipse parens ex
manumissione tutelam eius nanciscitur. Admonendi autem?
sumus liberum esse arbitrium ei, qui lilium et ex eo nepotem
vel neptem in potestate habebit, filium quidem de potestate
dimittere, nepotem vero vel neptem retinere: et ex diverso

fied : (1) The consent of the pater ; the general mle is stated in ς 9 inf,
to which a fewexceptions are noticed in Dig. 1. 7. 32. 33 ; 27.10. 16 3 35.
1. 923 37. 12. 1-2‚ ib. 5. (2) The consent of the child: it was sufficient,
however, if he did not protest against the emancipation: ‘solvere ius
potestatis invitis liliis non est permissum patribus’ Nov. 89. 11 pr. (3) Due
performance of the act of emancipation. This, as described by Gaius
(i. 132), was efl‘ected hythe pater's mancipating the child to a friend fidu·
ciae causa, who remancipated him to the pater, and by the latters then
manumitting him, like a slave, vindicta lf it were ason three mancipa-
tious were necessary, owing to the rule of the XII Tables, ‘si pater filium
ter venumduit, a patre filius liber esto :’ after each of the two first mau-
cipations he was manumitted by the alienee‚ whereby he again fell
under the patria potestas ; the third mancipation was made cum fiducia,
and was followed by remancipation to, and manumission by, the eman·
cipating father, unless the remancipation were dispensed with, and the
child were actually manumitted hythe alienes, usually under an agree-
ment to hold the iura patronatus in trust for the father ; see on Bk. iii. 2.
8 inf. For this clumsy form Justinian substituted (Cod. 8. 49 6) a
simple declaration before a judge or magistrate, which was registered in
the acta. ‘Recta via‚’ in the text, is explained by Cod. 8. 49. 6 ‘sine
sacro rescripto,' a reference to emancipation by imperial rescript, which
was introduced by Anastasius (Cod. loc. cit. 5), and was mainly resorted
to when absence of the child presented the old form from being em-
ployed. For the effect of emancipation on filiusfamilias’ property see
Bk. ii. ᾳ 2, and notes inf.: he was allowed to retain his peculium pro-
fectitium unless it was expressly taken from him, fragm. Vat. 25 5.261. Of
the iura patronatus, said in the text to have been given to the emanci-
pating pater by the edict, the most important was the right of succession,
guaranteed hythe praetor through the system of bonorum possessio 3 see
Bkiii.2.6inf.,andDig.37.12.1. 1.
