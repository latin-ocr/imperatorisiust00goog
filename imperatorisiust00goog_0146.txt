QUIBUS thDIS tus POTESTATIS SOLVITUR.

Videamus nunc, quibus modis ii, qui alieno ‚iuri subiecti
sunt, eo iure liberantur. et quidem servi quemadmodum
potestate liberantur, ex his intellegere possumus, quae de
servis manumittendis superius exposuimus. hi vero, qui in
potestate parentis sunt, mortuo eo sui iuris fiunt. sed hoc

person, though certainly the words read in favour of the former view.
According to that, his argument would seem to have been as follows :-
a slave can become free bya resolution of the people, without manu·
mission by his dominus: consequently adrogation by his master (which
took place populi auctoritate) must make him free too. But possibly
Cato was thinking of the second case, which many of the older jurists
regarded as quite lawful: alioquin si iuris ista antiquitas servetur, etiam
servus a domino per praetorem dari in adoptionem potest, idque ait
(Sabinus) plerosque iuris veteris auctores posse fieri scripsisse, Gellius
5. 19. Adoption (until Justinian) involved a vindicatio, as the adoptans
claimed the adoptee as his son from his present father, and we may sup·
pose that the jurists referred to by Gellius inferred from this vindicatio
a tacit vindicatio ‘in libertatem,' and treated the giving in adoption
as equivalent to a manumission by vindicta. The words of Gellius,
however, strongly suggest that under the late law slaves could not be
given in adoption by their masters. The constitution referred to by
justinian is in Cod. 7. 6. to.

The acta intervenientia were the official records ofa magistrate or
judge Even under the Republic it had not been unusual for magis·
trates to cooperate in private dispositions by entering a minute of them
in their records (gesta et acta), which entry served as irrefragable
evidence of the transaction. Later,a special effect was in some cases
given to such entries by statute (e. g. in testaments, and in the appoint-
ment of procurators), and after Constantine ‘insinuatio' or entry in the
acta was required by statute to give validity to many dispositions. Thus
in Dig. 2. 4. 17 we have apud acta promittere (cf. Blr. ii. 7. 2 inf.): actis
mandatum insinuare (Bk. iv. 11.3inf): actorum testificatione conficere
donationem (Cod. 8. 54 7): apud acta contestari (Dig. 50. 2. 7. 3) ι inter·
rogari et profiteri (Cod. 7. 16. ²4); and judicial appeals were also regis·
tered in the acta, apud or inter acta appellare, Dig. 49. r. 2. ψ The
right to take acta belonged to municipal magistrates (Paul sent. rec. 1.
3. r, Cod 1. 56. 2) as wellas to magistrates with jurisdiction.
