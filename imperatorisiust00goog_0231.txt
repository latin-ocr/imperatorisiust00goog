furtivarum et vi possessarum rerum usucapionem per legem

analogy ol Theodosius Il's prescription ol actions, he enacted that thirty
years’ possession ol property, moveable or immoveable, should confer
ownership, whether it admitted ol the ordinary usucapio orno, and even
in the absence ol iustus titulus, Cod. 7. 39. This was called longissimi
temporis praescriptio.

ξ 1. The mention ol the runaway slave in this rather than in the next
section (‘ ancilla fugitiva sui furtum facere intellegitur' Dig. 47. 2. 60; cf.
Cod. 6. 1. 1) is perhaps due to the senatus-consult (Dig. 48. 15. 2) which
prohibited alienation ol fugitivi, and so might be said in some sense to
have placed them in the category of res extra commercium.

ξ 2. The relation between the enactment ol the Twelve Tables and the
lex Atinia (which apparently was passed about the middle of the second
century Β. e.) seems to have been that the latter, while repeating the
prohibition ol the former, added that the vitium furti should be purged
as soon as the object returned to the possession ol the owner, Dig. 41.

Τὴε lex Plautia (tac. 59) and the lex Iulia (probably ol Augustus)
were less stringent than the other two statutes. The latter had said
that stolen property should in no case be thus acquired, even by an
innocent holder lor value (ξ 3) ; the former merely excluded the violent
dispossessor himself, and not his innocent transferee or other person.
They related practically to land only, lor this did not come within the
operation ol the Twelve Tables and lex Atinia, see on ξ 7 inf.

ξ 3. The vitium furti was purged, and the thing recovered the capacity
ol being acquired by usucapio, by returning into the hands ol its owner
(ξ 8 inl.; cs. Blc iv. 1. 12) or of his agent to his knowledge. Hence is
a man steals his own property (e. g. from a usufructuary or bona fide
