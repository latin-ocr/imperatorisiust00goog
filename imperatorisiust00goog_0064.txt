ms RESPONDENDI-CONFLICT OF RESPONSA, 51

bringing it into connection with, and placing it in a subordinate
relation to, the new imperial system. He resolved to make the
iunction ol a jurist, so far as the class was to possess any authority,
aquasipublic function 3 and this was effected by conlerring on
certain jurists the ius respondendi, whereby their responsa would be
given, as it were, under imperial sanction: ‘et‚ ut obiter sciamus, ante
tempora Augusti publice respondendi ius non a principibus dabatur, ,
sed, qui fiduciam' studiorum suorum habebant, consulentibus re-
spondebant. Neque responsa utique signata dabant, sed plerumque
judicibus ipsi scribebant, aut testabantur, qui illos consulebant Pri·
mus divus Augustus, ut maior iuris auctoritas haberetur, constituit, ut
ex auctoritate eius responderent, et ex illo tempore peti hoc pro
beneficio caepit. Et ideo optimus princeps Hadrianus, cum ab eo
viri praetorii peterent, ut sibi liceret respondere, rescripsit eis, hoc
non peti, sed praestari solere, et ideo, si quis fiduciam sui haberet,
delectari se, populo ad respondendum se praepararet' (Pomponius in
Dig. 1. 2. a. 49). Α form was thus prescribed in which official responsa
should be delivered ; they must be written and scaled by their author,
aa a precaution against lorgery. This practice ol investing certain
selected jurists with the ius respondendi was lollowed by Augustus'
successors, and the prerogative was constandy assuming more and
more the character ol a magisterial iunction; thus Gaius (i. 7) defines
the prudentes as those ‘quibus permissum est iura condere,’ and a
later writer speaks ol a jurist being possessed ol νομοθετικὴ δύναμις. lt
is not certain what discretion a iudex had under the older system
as to accepting or rejecting the opinion of a prudens whom he
consulted. Now, however, he was obliged to decide in accordance
with the advice ol any Jurist to whom the ius respondendi had been
delegated hythe Emperor. Yet among those who were possessed ol
this privilege there was no ascertained order ol precedence ; how then
was the matter decided il the two parties to an action submitted
discordant responsa? In such a case we must suppose that the
judge was free to choose'whichever ol the two opinions seemed to
him the more satisfactory. But the difficulty became greater as in
course of time the writings ¹ol the privileged jurists, the ‘iuris auc·
tores,' accumulated3 lor these writings were as authoritative as the
responsa, ol which in a large degree they consisted (whence Justinian
says (cod. i. ιγ. 1. 4) ‘Antiquomm prudentium, quibus anctoritatem
conscribendarum interpretandammque legum sacratissimi principes
praebuemnt'); and it obviously became easier every day lor a party
to quote hom this or that jurist a view diametrically opposed to the
