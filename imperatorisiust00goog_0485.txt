EXCURSUS VII.

JOINT AND SEVERAL LIABILITY. CORREALlTY AND
SOLIDARITY.

Trur simplest type ol obligation is that in which there is but a
single creditor and a single debtor. There may, however, possibly be
two or more creditore, or two or more debtors, in the same obligation,
Sometimes, it is true, this plurality ol parties is apparent only, and not
real: it is seen, ona closer scrotiny, that there are, in reality‚ a
number ol separate obligations, each with its single creditor and its
single debtor, and each distinguishable from each ol the rest: the
misapprehension arising from the fact that there is something which ‚
connects the several obligations with one another. For instance, if
A, Β, and C jointly promise 5l. to D, or il D promises 15l. to A, Β,
and C jointly, Dcan claim only 5l. from each os the promisors singly,
or each of the promisees can recover only 51. from him Or again,
il a debtor or creditor dies, leaving several joint heire, they are en·
titled or bound, and can sue or be sued, only in the ratio ol their
shares in the inheritance. In all these cases there is no single obli·
gation with a plurality ol parties on either the creditor or the debtor
side: there is a number ol separate and distinct obligations, which, in
our mindS, are connected together by the unity ol the mode in which
they originate.

A different form ol apparent unity ol obligation is that, where two
or more persons are entitled or bound in the sense that each may
claim, orbe called upon to perform, the whole ol what is due under
the obligation, that whole being demandable as many times as there
are creditors or debtors respectively. E. g. the law imposes a penalty
ol rol. on any one who steals pheasants' eggs. A, B, and C together
go and steal D's pheasants' eggs: D can recover the rol. penalty
from each ol the three in successi0n‚ exactly as if he were the only
delinquent, oras il the thelts were independent or disconnected.
Roman law supplies an illustration in Dig. 9. a. 11. a ‘ex lege Aquilia
quod alius praestitit alium non relevat, cum sit poena! So too is D
injures A, B, and C by the same act, they can each separately recover ,
from him the penalty fixed by law: the obligations are independent,
though arising lrom one and the same source.

But a third case is conceivable. There may be one creditor entitled
