28 INTRODUCTION.

digenous law oi Rome, aa contrasted either with the whole ius gen-
tium, or with such part of the latter as was taken up by the praetor

into his edict Its sources are enumerated in a passage already cited,
as ‘leges plebiscita, senatus consulta, decreta principum, auctoritas
prudentium! Only the fimt two of these are oi practical importance
until the establishment of the empire. but all are explained below or
in the Commentary on Book 1. Title a. Cicero (Top. 5) adds to
these sources oi the civil law three others, viz. res iudicatae, mos
(ci. Inst. i. a. 9), and aequitas. Usage‚ as a source ol positive law,
will be treated in the passage os the Institutes referred to ¹. The
authority oi precedents, expressly recognised hy a rescript of Severus,
was established, as we may gather from Cicero, at a sar earlier period.
‘Nam imperator noster Severus rescripsit, consuetudinem aut rerum
perpetuo similiter iudicatarum auctoritatem vim legis obtinere de-
bere’ (Callistratus in Dig. 1. 3. 38). By res iudicatae in Roman law
are to be understood those mles of customary law which gained
acceptance by the uniformity oi their pidicial application to individual
cases, and which, according to Austin, are the only true customary
law whatsoever; among them the most important were the prae·
iudicia oi the centumviral court. Their importance, however, as a
source oi law is so tristing that neither Gaius nor Justinian mentions
them ; and this is one of the most interesting points oi difference
between the English and the Roman system, which Sir Henry Maine
explains by the difference in their early history: ‘The theoretical
descent oi Roman jurisprudence stom a code, the theoretical ascrip-
tion oi English law to immemorial unwritten tradition, were the chief
reasons why the development of their system differed from the de-
velopment oi ours’ By ‘aequitas' Cicero seems to have meant the
internal‚ living, intellectual principle which is an clement in all law,
and consequently not a distinct source from which a particular kind
os positive law is generated; his use oi the term is popular rather

expressions may be noticed. (1) In some passages ius civile signihes the older
civil law, whatever its specihc source, as contrasted with later enactments which
either (a) partook oi the nature of ius gentium (thus in Gaius ii. 197, 8, it is
opposed to the SC. Neronianum), or (b) were based on politioal rather than on
purely legal considerations (thus in Gaius ii. 206, and Ulp. Reg. ²4· 12. 13. it is
opposed to the lex Papia Poppaea). (a) Itis sometimes opposed to the criminul
law (eg. Cicero iu Verrem i. 42, pro Caecina a). (3) In Dig. 1. a. a.5 andra
itis used to denote the law made by the Roman jurists, ‘quod sine scripto iu sola
pmdentium interpretatione consistit! (4) It sometimes expresses the ius Quiri·
tium aa summcd up in the Twelve Tables.
