EARLIER HISTORY OF ROMAN CIVIL PROCEDURE· 641

niary penalty, and refused or was unable to pay, the praetor would
grant possession of his estate to the quaestors, who sold it to the
highest bidder (sector). This principle was first extended to private

debts by a praetor called, according to Gaius (iv. 35), Publius Ruti·
lius, apparently the Rutilius who was consul nc. 105, after whose
reform ‘Proprietary’ execution was called bonorum emptio or ven·
ditio ¹. The procedure is fully described by lllr. Poste in the note
already referred to. The creditor or creditors were put in possession
of the bankrupt's estate by the praetor; then, at fixed intervals, fol·
lowed three decrees; the first advertising the sale, the second autho-
rising the creditors to choose from among themselves a ‘magister’ to
superintendit, and the last enabling them to publish the leges or
conditions under which it would take place. finally, after a third in-
terval, the estate or universitas iuris was put up to auctiori, and knocked
down to the highest bidder, i.e. the person who practically offered
the creditors the highest percentage on their claims. and who was
regarded, by a fiction, as the bankrupt's heir, in which character he
sued the debtors of the estnte; or, as an alternative for this fiction,
he might employ the formula Rutiliana (Gaius iv. 35), in which he
was represented as the insolvent's agent, the insolvent being named
in the Intentio, and himself in the Condemnatio. These proceedings
Ι did not exempt the after-acquired property of the bankrupt from the
claims of his creditors, who could take action against him repeatedly
until they had been satisfied in full; and in consequence of them he
became infamis. For many years creditors seem to have had the
privilege of choosing between the two systems, the dehtor having no
means of saving himself from the semi-servitude of the older procedure
if his adversary preferred it to bonorum venditio; but hythe introduc·
tion of cessio bonorum, under oue of the first two Caesars, this ccased
to be the case under ordinary circumstances. The nature of cessio
bonorum has already been described in the note upon Blr. iii. 12 supr.

lt has been observed that (apart from certain exceptional cases
under the legis actio procedure) we meet with no execution for deb!

upon the application of a judgment creditor, to send an officer of

the debtor leaving no lnwful successor civil or praetoriam
