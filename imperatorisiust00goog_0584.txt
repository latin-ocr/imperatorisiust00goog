§a Thus the engagement entered into in Justinian’s time by a
defendant who appeared in person covered the ground os both (r) tbe
old vadimonium or cautio iudicio sisti, Gaius iv. 185, which secured the
appearance ol the defendant in iure in cases oi adjoumment, and (2) the
clause de re defendenda oi the security iudicatum solvi 3 it bound him to
appear in court on the day oi trial and defend the action: but he was no
longer required to guarantee satisfaction of the judgment. The ordinary
mode oi entering into this engagement was satisdatio; but even before
the time ot' Gaius the praetor had drawn distinctions in vadimonia, being
satisfied in some cases with a merely personal undertaking without
sureties (vadimonium purum), and in others with such undertaking
tortilied hythe oath or bya summary process sor the recovery oi the
recognisance(‘recuperatoribus suppositis'Gaius iv. 185). Under Justinian
landowners (Dig. 2. 8. 15) and personae illustres (Cod. 12. 1. 17) could be
compelled to bind themselves in iudicio permanere usque ad terminum
litis only by a written cautio iuratoria ; it is not clear who were privileged
to give a bare promise to this effect, though the edict seems to have con·
tained careiul regulations on the subject, Gaius loc. cit: ‘pro tenore
generalium edictorum’ Cod. r2. 22. 8.

§3- The general principle as to when a procurator who appears as
plaintiti must give security ratam rem dominum habiturum is found in
Cod. 2. ¹3· 1 ‘cautio ratihabitionis tunc exigitur a procuratore, quotiens
incertum est an ei negotium mandatum est‚' cf. Dig. 3. 4 6. 3 ‘si de
decreto dubitetur, puto interponendam et de rato cautionem! The
agent was also exempted where bis appointment was notitiedtby letter to
the other party, note on Tit ro. pr. supr, or was evidenced by a libellus
addressed to the emperor, Dig. 46. h 21.

§4 Α procurator appointed in court (praesens) was thus in thesaure .
