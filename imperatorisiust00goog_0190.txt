INYRODUCTION TO BOOK II. 177

fluous to multiply instances irom the law of contract and delict, ior
the objection that nearly the whole of the law relating to remedial
rights, which as a matter os fact is placed under the head os actions,
would on his hypothesis belong to the law oi res, is latai by itseli.

A iar tntcr explanation of this branch oi the system is given by
Professor Holland (Jurisprudence p. 85), who, following Savigny
(System ξ 53), detines it as the department ol law which treats oi
such modifications oi rights as result irom varieties in the objects
or in the acts with which they are concerned. “‘ Res '' (the Roman
lawyers tell us), are either “ corporesl,'' things which can be touched,
such as a farm, a slave; or “ incorporeal‚” which cannot be touched,
consisting in right only, such as a right ol servitude, a right of action,
a right arising out oi contract. Now “corporeal'' things are obviously
what we have called the “objects ” of the right ; “incorporem'’ things
arc the advantages which the person entitled can insist upon; in other
words, “the acts or forbearances” to which he is entitled’ Though
this may be true in the abstract, it seems erroneous to credit Gaius,
to whom Justinian owed his classification, with a conscious juristic
analysis of which there is uo clear indication in his writings, and
whose importance, though familiar to us, seems to have first been
placed in clear light by the continental jurists from whom it was
derived by Austin.

The true point of contact between the various res seems in reality
to be the lact that whoever has a res is, actually or prospectively, so
much the better off. lt then we embrace everything by acquiring
which a man is materially better off-be it an estate or a five-pound
note, a ius in re aliena or an inheritance, a right oi action on a con-
tract ora delict—under the general nodon of property, we shall find
iu the ius quod ad res pertinet the law os proprietary relations, which
. is treated under the heads oi Ownership, real rights less than Owner-
ship, Possession, Inheritance‚ other universal successions, Contracts
and Delicts. Os ownership or dominium, as a right or aggregate oi
rights, we are told little in the abstract; we have to gather its content
from isolated passages. That it includes the rights of use and en-
J'oyment is clear srorn the power oi the dominus to separate thern
off irom his dominium, and vest them in other persons as distinct and
independent iura in re aliena (Tit 4. 1): from Tit. r. 12 we gather
that the owner has the exclusive right to the thing, and may lawlully
prohibit others from interiering with his own enjoyment os it; the right
oi alienation inter vivos is stated emphatically in Tit. 1. 40: that oi
testamentary disposition is attested by the phrase oi the Twelve
