est, quod clam et obscure fit et plerumque nocte: vel a

different species of theft (for of these there are but two, §3 inf), but to

suggest the comprehensive character of the delict, and the chief forms
which the contrectatio might take. Its meaning in effect is this: the
general character of ¹furtum consists in intentionally dealing with a res
mobilis in a wrongful manner, and usually the res is aliena, whether the
intention be to appropriate ownership in it (ipsius rei) or merely to use it
in an unauthorized manner (usus); but it is possible to commit thett on
property of one’s own, though to do this it is as a rule essentia} that the
property should be in the lawful possession of another person, the in-
tention being to dispossess the latter (possessionis). By Tbeophilus
furtum possessionis is understood to mean the wrongful appropriation of
a thing by a person who already has possession or detention of it (ὅτε τὸ
δοθὲν e’rri τῷ νέμεσθαι r‘or ἐνέχυρον ἢ dis dsrrdmrnv νέμομαι r‘or δεσπότης), in
other words, the arbitrary and wrongful conversion of detention or civil
possession into usucapion possession corpore et animo; but this is rather
furtum ipsius rei, and Theophilus’ view is discountenanced by §§ 6-10
inf: cf. Dig. 47. 2. 74. ¹

Furtum then may occur in any of the following ways :

(1) Theft in the popular sense : ‘cum quis rem alienam invito domino
contrectat' ξ 6; ‘fur est, qui dolo malo rem alienam contrectat' Paul. sent.
rec. 2. 3¹· 1.

(2) The wrongful appropriatlon ofa res aliena which one already
possesses or detains, eg. as depositary, agent, usufructuary, etc. (cf.
Theophilus supr.) ; of this no illustrations are given in this Title, but see
Dig. 47. 2. r. ²3 ib. 335 ib.43.1; 16. 3. ²9 ; 17. r. 22 7.

(3) The wrongful appropriation of property found, Bk. ii. 1. 48 supr,
beonnam

(4) Tbe mala fide alienation of a res aliena, Bk ii. 6. 3 supr.

(5) The wilful destruction of bonds in order to destroy evidence of debr,
Dig. 47. 2. 283 ib. 3²3 ib. 4 52·

(6) Tne wrongful using of a res aliena of which one has possession or
detention, e. g. by depositarius, pledgee, or commodatarius, ᾗ 6inf.

(7) Furtum of res sua, ξ ιο aud notes, inf.

For the prohibition of furtum by natural law cf. cte. de off. 3. ς ‘illud
natura non patitur, ut aliorum spoliis nostras facultates augeamus?
Augustin. Confess. a 41 ‘furtum certe punit lex scripta in cordibus
hominurn.¹ Among certain peoples (e g. the Egyptians, Lacedaemonians,
and Samians) theft is said to have been allowed by their own municipal
law; Diodor. Sic. 1. 80, Xenophon, rep. Laced 2. 8, Plutarch, Lycurgus
12.
