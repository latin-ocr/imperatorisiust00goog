habeat heres ex voluntate testatoris quartam sive plus slve
minus sive penitus nihil, ut tunc, quando vel nihil vel minus
quarta apud eum remaneat, liceat ei vel quartam vel quod
deest ex nostra auctoritate retinere vel repetere solutum,
quasi ex Trebelliano senatus consulto pro rata portione
actionibus tam in heredem quam in fideicommissarium com·
petentibus. si vero totam hereditatem sponte restituerit,
omnes hereditariae actiones fideicommissario et adversus eum
competunt sed etiam id, quod praecipuum Pegasiani senatus
consulti suerat, ut, quando recusabat heres scriptus sibi datam
hereditatem adire, necessitas ei imponeretur totam heredi·
tatem volenti fideicommissario restituere et omnes ad eum et
contra eum transire actiones, et hoc transponimus ad senatus
consultum Trebellianum, ut ex hoc solo et necessitas heredi
imponatur, si ipso nolente adire fideicommissarius desiderat
restitui sibi hereditatem, nullo nec damno nec commodo

retaining those provisions os the SC. Pegasianum which gave the heir a
right to a fourth or the inheritance clear of fideicommissa, and which
enabled the heres fideicommissarius to compel the direct heir to make
aditio, but repealing that which had suspended the operation of the
SC. Trebellianum where the fideicommissa exceeded in amount three·
lourths oi the hereditas. Under his system, whenever a definite fraction
ol an inheritance is transferred under a fideicommissum, the transieree is
in loco heredis, and capable ol suing and being sued, in the ratio oi the
share which comes to him.

'l'he right, which Justinian confers upon the heir, os recovering the
fourth even after be bad paid in excess to the fideicommissarius‚ was un-
known to the older law: ‘qui totam hereditatem restituit, cum quartam
retinere ex Pegasiano debuisset, si non retineat, repetere eam non potest,
nec enim indebitum solvisse videtur, quia plenam fidem defuncto prae·
stare maluit’ Paul sent. rec. 4 3. 4. ln Gaius' time (ii. 283) ii one by ·
mistake paid more than was due under a fideicommissum, the balance
could be recovered : with a legacy it was otherwise.

lt will be remembered that the partiary legatee was only a ‘singular'
successor: he became liable ior the testators debts, not ipso iure, in
virtue ol the transfer to him oi a share oi the hereditas, but only by
express agreement (stipulationes partis et pro parte) with the heir. After
Justiniau’s ‘exaequatio' os legacies and fideicommissa this ceased to be
so, and the partiary legatee became a universal successor just like the
heres fideicommissarius F or some illustrations of the joint operation οἱ
