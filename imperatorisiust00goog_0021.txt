8 INTRODUCTION.

which they retained for centuries after the assembly which passed them
had ceased to be a gathering in which the older populus took no part
or interest

Yet to have given Rome one new comitia was not sufficient for
Servius Tullius. It has been observed above, that the political changes
which resulted from the new position of the plebs were produced in
and through changes of military organization. By the new tribal
constitution, the old relation between infantry and cavalry, according
to which the former had been but a subordinate appendage of the
latter, had been superseded Nevertheless‚ the distinction of cavalry
and infantry still remained a distinction of caste; the patrician alone
could be an eques, the plebeian, however rich he might be, was con·
demned to serve on foot To reduce the prominence of the distinction
between plebs and populus, if not to sweep it away altogether, it
was necessary to disconnect the military organization from theold
constitution of curiae and gentes ; to substitute for this principle a new
one; to base the military system on a new idea. This new principle,
this new idea, were those of timocracy. The leading feature in
Servius' second reform was his division of the whole people, which
could be called on for infantry service, into five classes, in which each
man’s position was determined hythe amount of his property. The
first comprised all those whose property was valued at roo,oooasses
and upwards; of the second, the qualification was 75,000 asses ; of
the third, 5o,ooo; oi thefourth, 25,ooo ; of the fifth, 10,ooo. Those
citizens whose means did not qualify them even for this fifth grade,
belonged to subsidiary, but of course unimportant classes, known as
accensi velati and proletarii. To this proprietary classification cor·
responded an arrangement of the fighting men in centuries or com·
panies of a hundred. Of cavalry there were eighteen centuries, six of
which were drawn from the old populus, in accordance with the plan
of Tarquinius Priscus, and twelve from the plebs. The first of Servius’
new classes fumished eighty-two centuries of heavily-armed infantry;
the second, third, and fourth, twenty tighting centuries each, and also
a couple of additional companies, consisting of buglers and musicians3
thirty centuries were contributed by the tifth class; at each step down-
wards in the scale the armour became lighter, the equipmeut less com·
plete. The full number of centuries seems to have been one hundred
and ninetytwo.

It is, however, the political side of the centurial organization which
is of most interest in the history of Roman law, though this was not
a working reality until after the expulsion of the kings. The principle
