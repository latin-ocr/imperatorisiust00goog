tion. This resembles the former, in that two or more creditors (correi
stipulandi or credendi) are entitled against one debtor‚ or two or more
debtors (correi promittendi or debendi) are bound to one creditor iu
respect 01 0330 and the same obligation-object, and so 133 we may
say that every correal includes in itsell a solidary obligation, each os
the two or more creditors being entitled, and each 01 3130 two or more
debtors being bound, in solidum. But it differs in that there is not
only one obligation-object, but only one obligation. The unity 01 the
object here follows necessarily from the unity 01 the obligation itsell:
where the liability is solidary, it arises from extraneous causes, 103,

given a variety 01 obligations, the natural 3ηά usual consequence .

would be 3 corresponding variety 01 objecta.
’ 13 is thus the unity or identity 01 3130 obligation which distinguishes
correal from merely solidary obligation: or, to put the matter in
another lorm, when there is correality‚ there is, objectively, one
single obligation, to which a variety 01 persons are subjectively
related in solidum: 3ηά 313013 subiective relation may be different.

There is, objectively, but one single obligation. Hence any aet or
event (and not merely performance or its equivalent‚ as in cases 01
solidarity) which puts an end to the objective existence 01 31333 single
obligation between the creditor and one 01 the debtors‚ or the debtor
and one 01 3130 creditore, extinguishes it between them 311 ; 0. g. solutio
or performance, acceptilatio, and novatio (Dig. 46. 3. 31. 3). Com·
pensatio, or set-off, extinguishes correal obligation only if it goes to the

3130 creditors sued the debtor‚ the obligation was extinguished 103 all by
the action's reaching the stage 01 litis contestatio, Gaius iii. 180, Dig.
45. r. 116 ς 1333. 3; ib. 163 46. 3. 5. In respect 01 passive correal
obligation this was altered by Justinian's constitution in Cod. 8. 41. 28,
which enacted that the debt should not be extinguished by litis con·
testatio, but only by satisfaction 01 3130 creditor: 103 active correal
obligation theold rule seems to have continued, Dig. 45. 2. 3 ; 46. 1. 53
4⁶· 3. 31.1. Further consequences 01 the unity 01 the obligation are
' that any actos 3 correus debendi, by which its performance becomes
impossible or more difficult, prejudices the rest: ‘ex duobus reis eius·
