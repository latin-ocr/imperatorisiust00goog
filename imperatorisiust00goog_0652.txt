EARLIER HIS T ORV OF ROMAN CIVIL PROCEDURE. 639

Of the proceedings in iudicio Gaius gives us no information; they
consisted, of course, of evidence and argument, and may be passed
orer in favour of matters of which we have more accurate knowledge.
Assuming, however, that they terminate in a sententia for the plaintih'
(condemnatio), two new questions present themselves. Firstly, is the
judgment final? or is there any system of appeali And, secondly,
how is the defendant compelled to pay the money in which he has
been condemned? in other words, what are the proceediugs ina
Roman executioni

The strictly co-ordinate authority of the ‘magistratus maiores' in
republican Rome excluded the possibility of a true appellate juris- ,
diction in the pre-imperial period At that time, in fact, the sententia
of a iudex did not admit of revocation or alteration save by the
process of in integrum restitutio (note on Bk. iv. 6. 33), though it must
be remembered that judgment in an ordinary action was not abso·
lutely final; for the defendant, who was presumptively condemnatus,
could contest its validity by refusing to pay the sum in which he had
been condemned, and defending himself, at the rislt of condemnatio
in duplum, against the actio iudicati brought for its recovery. This,
· however, was not an appeal, which implies the rehearing of the suit
by a higher tribunal. With the fail of the Republic a regular appel-
late jurisdiction was rapidly developed, and the privilege of ‘ appealing
nnto Caesar’ was soon understood to be common to citizens of
Rome all over the empire. Under Augustus the praefectus urbi vas

judge of appeal for Rome, and a vir consularis, though sitting in '

the capital, bore the same relation to each of the provinces. Nero
invested the Senate vritb a supreme appellate jurisdiction coordinate
with his own, and by the time of M. Aurelius the right had been
· established of appealing from the sententia of a iudex to the magis
trate who appointed him. Thus the tribunals had gradually arranged
themselves in a definite series of higher and lower instance, and a suit
might be carried from iudex to Emperor through the appointing
municipal magistrate, the praetor or praeses, and the praefectus urbi
or praetorio in succession The procedure on appeal was that vhicb
wilt shortly be described as ‘extraordinaria' dispensing, in its com-
mencement, with the ordinary institution by formula, and terminating
in a decretum, not a sententia; definite periods of time were p‘re-
scribed within which the appeal must be lodged, and its various
stages completed A powerful check on rash appeals was the

fta alienation unlawful pendente lite, Gaius ir. try. (6) It preventa any subsequent
change iu the parties without complete resumption of the formula (Translatio).
