THE EARLl' COMITIA AND PLEBS. 5

sessed ol no civil rights whatever. Some sort ol legal status it was
deemed requisite to give them, and this was done by placing theru in
immediate relation to some paterfamilias, whereby he became their
patron, they his clients But with the family of their patron they had no
connection; their connection was with his gens ; they took the gentile
name, and became his ‘gentiles’ In this way they were brought
within the protection ol the law, as dependente ol a citizen 3 an object
which could not have been secured except by some such device, for
the primitive Roman law recognised no claim to its support unless the
claimant could in some vray show that he was within the pale of the
tribal constitution. But the clientes acquired no political rights, though
the public duty oi military service was imposed upon theru, and a con-
siderable lorce oi intanuy was thus added to the resources of the
state.

This process, however, of attaching all peregrini residing on Roman
soil to the populus by the tie oi clientela could not be prolonged
indefinitely. circumstances were gradually augmenting the number ol
non-citizens so largely as to necessitate some new mode ol dealing
with these classes. The military temper and strong organisation ol
the Roman people resulted in a continuous addition ol territory to the
domains ol the city ; little districts, principally oi Latin population,
were constantly being annexed, and their villages razed, the inhabitants
being encouraged to iloclr towards Rome, because thus they could be
most easily cowed into obedience and hindered lrom rebellion. These
immigrants were at first settled on the stretch of land, bordering the
three hills ol the populus, lrnown lrom them as esquiliae; as their
numbers swelled, king Ancus, who was afterwards honoured as the
founder ol the plebs (⁴ Romuli Ancique gentem ’ Catullus 34), assigned
them the Aventine as a dwellingplace. This was the population
which became the plebs, and which played so important a part in the
strictly legal, no less than in the constitutional‚ history oi Rome. The
question how to deal with them became daily a more pressing political
problem. To incorporate them into the existing tribe-economy was,
to Roman ideas, quite out of the questi0n; the populus, being based
upon the gentes, was a kind oi close corporation whose constitution
was limited by the delinite number ol gentile aggregates The plebs
then must remain a body apart from the populus, and therefore its
members could have no political rights. But there seemed no reason
why the private should not be separated lrom the public elements ol
the law ; and the result—whether it should be ascribed to a happy
accident, or to the deepseated legal instincts ol the Roman race-
