Titia] QUIBUS MODIS RE C ONT RAHI Τ UR OBLIGATIO. 383

dubium non est, quin de restituenda ea re tenearis. com-
modata autem res tunc proprie intellegitur, si nulla mercede
accepta vel constituta res tibi utenda data est. alioquin
mercede interveniente locatus tibi usus rei videtur: gratuitum
enim debet esse commodatum. Praeterea et is, apud quem3
res aliqua deponitur, re obligatur et actione depositi, qui et
ipse de ea re quam accepit restituenda tenetur. sed is ex eo
solo tenetur, si quid dolo commiserit, culpae autem nomine,
id est desidiae atque neglegentiae, non tenetur: itaque securus

sonable care (diligentia, ior which see Excursus Vl at the end oi this
Book) were (1) to restore the object lent at the time agreed upon, orso
soon as the purpose lor which it was lent was satisfied: it could be re·
demanded earlier only upon breach os another general term ol the con·
tract, viz. (a) to use it only lor the purpose lor which it was lent: to use
it lor others was thest, is the borrower was aware that the other would
not have pennitted it, Bk. iv. 1. 6-8 ins, (3) to return it in as good con·
dition as when received, excepting such deterioration as naturally results
from its use, or as might reasonably have been expected: ‘si reddita

‚ quidem sit res commodata, sed deterior reddita, non videtur reddita, quae
deterior iacta redditur, nisi quod interest praestetur: proprie enirn dicitur
res non reddita quae deterior redditur’ Dig. 13· 6. 3. 1: lor the excep·
tions see ib. 23, and 5. 7, cited in Hunter's Roman Law p. 302, (4) to
restore not only it, but also any gain which he may have made by using
it in a manner not authorized hythe contract, Dig. ib. 13. 1.

Like depositum, pignus, and mandatum, commodatum is said to be au
imperiectly bilateral contract: i.e. as a general rule, only one ol the
parties (the borrower) is bound, and only one (the lender) is entitled.
But very osten a liability of the latter will an‘se from circumstances pos·
terior to the contract itsell ι thus, in commodatum, though (4) supr.
implies that all ordinary expenses in connection with the object lent must
be borne by the borrower, the lender will be bound to indemnify him sor
any extraordinary costs necessarily incurred: e. g. ‘quicquid in rern com-
modatam ob morbum vel aliam rationem impensum est a domino recipi
potest' Paul. sent rec. 2. 4. 1 : or'lor any injury caused by it to the bor·
rower or his property, is this can be attributed to the fault os the lender:
eg. Dig. 13· 6. 22. Tbese duties can be ensorced against the lender
either by retentio (lien) or by actio commodati (contraria).

(8. Like commodatum, depositum was a gratuitous contract: in the
absence of special agreement, the depositary’s duties were as follow: (1)
to take the same care ol the res deposita as he took ot his own: ‘nisi
tamen ad suum modum curam in deposito praestat, fraude non caret:
nec enim salva fide minorem his quam suis rebus diligentiam praestabit’
Dig. 16. 3. 32, hence he was not answerable is the property was stolen,
though as a rule it was presumed that allowing theit argued absence os
diligentia exacta, Dig. 17. 2. 52. 3: (a) to return it in as good condition
