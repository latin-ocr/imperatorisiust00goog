acivili data ac permissa. Tutores autem sunt, qui eam vim ac
potestatem habent, ex qua reipsa nomen ceperunt. itaque
appellantur tutores quasi tuitores atque defensores, sicut
3aeditui dicuntur qui aedes tuentur. Permissum est itaque
parentibus liberis impuberibus, quos in potestate habent, testa·
mento tutores dare. et hoc in filio filiaque omnimodo procedit 3
nepotibus tamen neptibusque ita demum parentes possunt
testamento tutores dare, si post mortem eorum in patris sui
potestatem recasuri non sunt. itaque si filius tuus mortis tuae
tempore in potestate tua sit, nepotes ex eo non poterunt
testamento tuo tutorem habere, quamvis in potestate tua
fuerint3 scilicet quia mortuo te in patris sui potestatem re·

duntaxat his vestibus, quae detritae usu, aut corruptae servando servari
non potuerint. Animalia quoque supervacua minorum, quin veneant,
non vetamus’ Cod ς. 37. aa. Justinian forbade tutors and curators to
intermeddle in the ward's affairs until they had caused a complete in-
ventory of his property to be made, Cod. ς. 51. ult. But on ceasing to
be infans the pupil was held to acquire a power of volition, and thereby
capacity of disposition; yet his lack of intellectual powers was thought
likely to betray him into transactions by which he might be injured, and
thus the ruie was established, that forali acts by which the pupil could
possibly injure his proprietary interests the guardian’s auctoritas was
necessary, though the former was regarded as himself the acting party,
especially in dispositions which were iuris civilis, and therefore ‘procura-
torem non recipiebant3' see Tit. 21. pr. inf, and cf. the note on Ble iii.
19 ro referred to. The relation between guardian and pupil was quasi
ex contractu Bk. iii. 27. 2 ini, qv.

ξ 3. The right of the paterfamilias to appoint byhis will tutors to such
females in his power as would become sui iuris on his decease, and to
such males in the same position as were impuberes, was established, if
not for the first time conferred, by the Xll Tables: ‘testamento quoque
nominatim tutores dati confirmantur eadem lege duodecim tabularum,
his verbis: nti legassit super pecunia tutelave suae rei, ita ius esto: qui
tutores dativi appellantur’ Ulpian, reg. 11. 14. The intended tutor must
have testamentifactio with the testator, and Latini luniani could not
be thus appointed, Gaius i. 24. It would seem that a testamentary
guardian could at one time decline the office, or even lay it down after
acceptance, Ulpian, reg. 11. 17: this right is not mentioned in Justinian,
which marks the transition from the conception of tutela as a right to
that of a munus publicum For the formulae by which testamentary
guardiam were appointed see Gaius i. 1493 for the effect of placing such
appointment before the institution of the heir, Gaius ii. 231 : cf. Tit 14.
3 inf. Α testamentary guardian might be appointed by codicils testa·
