622 EXCURSUS Χ.

’ Publilia; wherever else it was still avallable it was pura, and its only
peculiar incident was that the debtor was cast ιιι double damages it
he unsuccesssully denied his liability (lis crescens).

The Romans themselves never doubted that manus iniectio wasatrue
legis actio, though it was no less a form oi execution than pignoris
capio: the former was Personal, the latter was Real execution. The
lact would seem to be, as is remarked by Mr. Poste ¹, that manus iniectio
has two meanings. Sometimes it is a solemn act oi sels-remees, viz.
where the plaintili's right is incontesteble, and the defendant submits.
But at other times it is the first stage in a legis actio, viz. where the
defendant denies his liability, and resists the claim either in person
or through a vindex: and it seems probable that it was called
Statute-Process only in this latter case. Il thisbe true, the application
os the term ‘legis actio’ to pignoris capio alone remains anomalous.
So lar as we know it, pignoris capio was purely extra-judicial: it a
man had a claim which the law allowed him to eulorce iu this manner,
he had no need ol assistance irom the magistrate3 the praetor did not
appear at any stage ol the proceedings, which presented a picture ol
as pure sels-redress as could be sound before courts and magistrates
had come into existence. Why then is it called an ‘actio’ at all?
Arguing lrom the analogy ol manus iniectio, it would not be rash to
conjecture that pignoris capio also has two meanings, and that it was
a legis actio only when the person distrained upon denied his liability,
and pushed proceedings to a regular action. It is well known that
in the English law ol Distress this is done by an action os Replevin,
in which the distrainee is plaintiff and the distrainor defendant: but
the parallel ol manus iniectio makes it prohable that in Roman law
the telles were reversed, and that it the distress was alleged to be
unlawlul the distrainor was bound to come sorward as plaintiff ιιι au
action to justily his act, by forcing the other to redeem his pledge at
a price double the amount ol the original debt¹.

Ol the three other legis actiones it seems probable that the oldest
is the sacramentum. Gaius says it was ‘actio generalis: ie. the
proper remedy in all cases ior which no other procedure bad been
ordained by statute. Though he describes it to us as a real action,

¹ Gaius p. 507.

⁹ This conjecture is supported by the known sacts of the publicanus, whb was
allowed to proceed by pignoris capio even aster the introduction oi the formulary
system: and Gaius' words (iv. 32) suggest that the publicanus sued the taxpayer
who was in arrears in order to compel him to redeem the property seized at a sum

in ercess os that actually due. Cicero speaks (iu Verrem ιιι. ιι. ²7) oi ‘publica-
uus petitor ac pignerator!
