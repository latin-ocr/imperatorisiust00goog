EXCURSUS ΙΙ.

IURA IN RE ALIENA OTHER THAN SERVITUDES·

Sorssncrrs is s real (Dig. 3ο. 86. 4) right ol praetorian origin to
s building or psrt of one, either in perpetuity or ior s very extended
term, without any right to the soil upon which it stands: it is aius
in re cliens because ‘superficies solo cedit3’ the house is properly
owned by the owner oi the soil: ‘superficiarias aedes appellamus, quae
in conducto solo positae sunt, quarum proprietas et civili et naturali
inre eius est, cuius et solum' Dig. 43. 18. π. The modes in which
it could arise are—(r) contritot, whether it took the form oi gift, sale
(Dig. 43. 18. r. r), hire (the annual rent being cslled solarium), or
permissive building upon landos the state (Dig. 43. 8. 2.17)‚ors
private person; (s) legno„ (3) judicisl decree. Whether it could be
scquired by usucapio is much disputed: see Dig. 6. s. η. 3; 4ι. 3.
sd. superficies was cliensble inter vivos or by will (Dig. 43. 18. 7.
9), vas heritnble‚ and could be made the subject ois pledge or
servitude, Dig. ib. r. 6 and 7, ib. 9. For the protection oi his right
the superficierius could bring in their ‘utilis’ iorrn all the actions
svsilable to the dominus-rei vindicatio, negatoris, confessoris, and
' Publiciana, Dig. ib. 1. r. 3. 6; Dig. ό. r. 73. r, and he hsd aspecisl
interdici de superficie snalogous in operation to uti possidetis. That
he technioslly ‘possessed' the building seems to be proved by his
sbssity to bring directly the interdicte de vi end de precario, Dig. 43.
16.1.5; 43. 26. 2. pr. and 3.

Emphyteusis msy be traced back to the agri vectigales, large tracte
oi μυίης leod in Italy belonging to the state or the smaller civitates
sod municipia, but held and enjoyed by privste persons subject to the
pryment of a perpetual rent (vectigal), or let out upon lease ior very
long termo oi years The interest of such occupiers received s ‘resi'

session (Dig. ι. 8. 15. r) by interdicte, and by s utilis ectio in rem
(ectio vectigslis, Dig. 39. 2. 15. τό) svsilable even against the lessor
himself when non-psyment oi rent vrso not thegen ‘agri civitatum
