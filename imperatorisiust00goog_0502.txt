INTRODUCTION TO BOOK IV. 489

It is pointed out that a wrong of this sort may be inflicted upon one
in the person os one’s wile, children, or slaves; sor though the slave
himself has no rights whatever, and therefore no good name to injure,
yet the object ol an attach upon him may be to dishonour his master.
The penalty lor this offence, originally in some cases retaliatory, had
been altered by the praetor to a pecuniary mulct, which the injured
person was allowed within certain limits to fix himself 3 the considera·
tions upon which its amount depended were in the main his rank and
the circumstances under which the injury had been inflicted‚ which
would sometimes bring it within the category ol iniuria atrox. Among
minor points touched upon in the text are the bearing ol the les
Cornelia upon this subJect, the alternative criminal remedy, the lia·
bility ol accessories and instigators, and the extinction ol the actio
iniuriae by dissimulatio or condonation.

The filth Title illustrates the class os obligations which arise quasi
ex delicto, and which seem mainly to be cases oi vicarious responsi·
bility, such as that ol a householder sor damage caused by things
‘eflusa et deiecta’ from his residence‚ and ol an inn or stable keeper

lor the delicts ol his employe‘s. The reason why a judge was held
liable quasi ex delicto lor loss occasioned to suitors by his incapacity

or injustice would seem only to be that such an offence could not
be brought within the definition ol any ol the lour old established
Delicts.

At Title 6 we enter upon the discussion ol the last department oi
Private Law-the ius quod ad actiones pertinet. The division of law
into law ol Persons and law ol Things is perhaps as old as Cicero
(Invent i. 24), and apparently was the basis ol aclassification in the
Perpetual Edict (Dig. i. 5. 2); but Gaius, so far as we know, was the
first jurist who added the third division oi actiones. lt may be
doubted whether his own conception ol this branch ol his system was
as clear as a more modern writer might have made it. The term
acti0, as is shown in the note on Tit. 6. pr.‚ has a variety ol meanings
in the writings ol the Roman lawyers, and two ol them seem to be
more or less blended in Gaius' fourth Book, which wholly relates to
this topic. ln one sense, actio is a right ol action; and a treatise
upon rights ol action would correspond with what writers on analy-
tical Jurisprudence term the Law ol Sanctioning or Remedial
rights, In another sense actio means the Procedure in an action;
taken thus, the ius quod ad actiones pertinet would correspond to
what the same writers call Adjective Law, and which it is perhaps
more proper to regard as a part ol the Public rather than ol the
