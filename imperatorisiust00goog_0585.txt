position as a defendant's cognitor under the older system, Gaius iv. 101 ;
his principal, and nothe, had to give security iudicatum solvi, either
alone (cautio) or with sureties (satisdatio). This security consisted of
three clauses: ‘iudicatum solvi stipulatio tres clausulas in unum collatas
habet: de re iudicata, de re defendenda, de dolo malo' Dig. 46. 7. 6.
By the first of these the defendant and his sureties engaged, in case the
action went against him, to restore the property to which it related, or
pay the damages assessed by the judge, Gaius iv. 89 ; by the second, he
promised to defend the action ; by the third, to indemnify the plaintiff
against malicious deterioration of the disputed property while it was in
his hands. lt is not easy to see how, when the principal gave the
security ‘extra iudicium,' he could be said to become fideiussor for his
own procurator, who clearly gave no security at all. Perhaps, as the
latter was responsible for the conduct of the defense, he was held to be
impliedly liable on the clauses de dolo and de re defendenda, and his
principal became answerable, as fideiussor, for any prejudice which
might befall the plaintiff through his default in either of these respects.
So far as satisfaction of the judgment was concemed, he himself was
liable alone, and not the agent ; and ‘non intellegi posse, ut quis pro se
fideiubendo obligetur’ Dig. 46. 1. 21. 2. Another difficulty is raised by
the passage in the text which accounts for the compulsory hypotheca by
the desire to bind the real defendaut¹s heire, for they were in point of fact
already bound by his engagement iudicatum solvi. Perhaps this is to be
explained by supposing that formerly the sureties in this security were
sponsors or fidepromissors, whose liability did not descend to their
successors (Gaius iii. 120), and that these lines have been transcribed
from some old jurist into the Institutes by an oversight.
