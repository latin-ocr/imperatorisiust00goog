‘lit 14] DE HEREDIBUS INSTITUENDIS. 257

cim uncias, quae assis appellatione continentur. habent autem
et hae partes propria nomina ab uncia usque ad assem, utputa
haec: sextans, quadrans, triens, quincunx, semis, septunx, bes,
dodrans, dextans, deunx, as. non autem utiqueduodecim uncias
esse oportet. nam tot unciae assem efficiunt, quot testator volu·
erit, et si unum tantum quis ex semisse verbi gratia heredem
scripserit, totns as in semisse erit: nequeenim idem ex parte
testatus et ex parte intestatus decedere potest, nisi sit miles,
cuius sola voluntas in testando spectatur. et e contrario potest
quis in quantascumque voluerit plurimas uncias suam here·
ditatem dividere. Si plures instituantur, ita demum partiumti
distributio necessaria est, si nolit testator eos ex aequis parti·
bus heredes esse: satis enirn constat nullis partibus nomi-

§h The rules stated in this and the three following sections ior the
division oi an inheritance among two or more instituti may be sum·
marised thus :-

(1) 'ibe hereditas is conceived as an as oi twelve ounces, in fractions
oi which the heirs respectively are instituted or take: thus A may be
instituted ex quincunce (ἡ), and B ex septunce (ἡ).

(2) li the testator specifies no shares, the coheirs take ex aequis par·
tibus, ξ 6, unless itis clear that he intended otherwise: e. g. ‘Titius
heres esto: Seius et Maevius heredes sunto: verum est quod Proculo ’
placet, duos semisses esse, quorum alter coniunctim duobus datur¹
Dig. ad 5. 59. 2.

(3) libe specifies the shares ol one or some only, those to whom no
ahares are specifically assigned take in equal proportions the differente
between the sum oi the shares assigned and the aggregate os ff (e. g. A
heres ex sextante (l), B heres ex quincunce (st); C, the heir to whom
no share is assigned, takes ex quincunce as well). lt, however, the sum
nithe shares assigned exceeds tt, then the heirs whose shares are not
specified taire the difference between it and id, and, il this is exceeded, ll
andsoon, §§ 6 and 8.

(4) li he specifies shares ior each and all os the heirs, which, however,
do not together make up the number 12 or any multiple oi 12, their
shores are rateably increased until 12 or its next multiple is reached:
conversely, ii he gives away more than the as in fractions among all the
beirs, their shares are rateably diminished, ξ 7.

lt should be observed in addition that ii it is clear that the testatore
intention, in giving the instituted heirs less than the whole as, was to
limit thern, and ii it is certain to whom he meant the residue to go, they
otone oi them can be compelled to convey it to him as a fideicom-
missum3 and where a testator institutes one oi two heirs ex asse, and
the other in a fraction, the will is to be interpreted, as a rule, as il no
definite share had been assigned to the first at all, Cod, ⁶·‚372 23. pr. ,
