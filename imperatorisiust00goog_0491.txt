THE ROMAN LITERAL CONTRACT AND ITS HISTORII.

. Tur true old Roman literal contract, or expensilatio, which appar·
ently began to be disused soon after the sall ol the Republic,
· was concluded by the creditor's making, with the dehtor's assent, an
entry in his domestic account-book or ledger (codex, tabulae) osso
rnuch as advanced by him to the latter (expensum ferre), the transac'·
tion thus appearing as a loan actual or fictitious. Such a written
entry was not mere evidence of a contract binding on some other
ground-res, verba, or consensus: by itsels it laid the debtor under a
legal obligation to repay the sum inquestione ‘in nominibus alius
expensum serendo obligat' Gaius iii 137. There are at least two
passages (Cic. ad Ata 4. ep. 18, Valerius Maximus 8. π. a) which

. prove that expensilatio was amode oI creating a new and original

obligation. But it seems most ordinarily to have been employed lor
the purpose of novation (Bu iii. ²9· 3), when it was called transcrip-
tio, and the entry ‘nomen transcripticium’ Gaius iii. 128: and ln the
form transcriptIo a persona in personam (‘ veluti si id quod mihi Titius
debet, tibi id expensum tulero ' Gaius loc. cit), it must among business
men have been oI great value in the simplification and settlement ol
outstandIng accounts. The main object ol transcriptio seems to have
been the substitution of a strict civil law sor a iuris gentium contract3
or, as Mr. Poste puts its, ‘to metamorphose claims recoverable by
actions ex fide bona, eg. locati conducti, empti venditi, which ln many
points favoured the defendant, into debts recoverable by the short and
sharp remedy of the civil action ol condictio, which, when brought sor
certa pecunia credita, was the more lormidable to a dishonest liti·
gant, as it was accompanied by a sponsio poenalis, whereby the van·
quished party forfeited a third ol the sum in litIgation, iu addition, if
he was the defendant, to the original claim! That this was its main
use seems more than probable on a priori grounds, lor it is clear that
ilgol. are due toa man on a sale (eg), he will prefer to secure by
novation a remedy by which he can recover 4ol.; and the conclusion
is made absolutely certain by a consideration of the only case in which
