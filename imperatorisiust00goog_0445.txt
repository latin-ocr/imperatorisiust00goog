communicare: si quid vero aliud lucrifaceret, quod non cap·
taverit, ad ipsum solum pertinet: ei vero, cui renuntiatum eet,
quidquid omnino post renuntiatam societatem adquiritur, soli
tconceditur. Solvitur adhuc societas etiam morte socii, quia
qui societatem contrahit certam personam sibi eligit. sed
etsi consensu plurium societas coita sit, morte unius socii
solvitur, etsi plures supersint, nisi si in coeunda societate

. stated ; a partner who withdrew at a time, or in a manner which would
prejudice the interests os the societas, could be compelled to compensate
his socii, Dig. 17.2.14; ib. 17. ²3 and if his obJ'ect was ‘ut obveniens
aliquod lucrum solus habeat) and the expected gain turned out a loss, he
had to bear it alone: ‘Cassius scripsit eum, qui renunciaverit societati, a
se quidem liberare socios suos, se autern abillis uon liberare: quod
utique observandum est, si dolo malo renunciatio facta sit, veluti si, cum
omniurn bonorum societatem inissemus, deinde cum obvenisset uni
hereditas, propter hoc renunciavit ; ideoque si quidem damnum attulerit
hereditas, hoc ad eum qui renunciavit pertinebit, commodum autem com·
manicare cogetur actione pro socio’ Dig. 17. 2. 65. 3. So too is one of
two partners renounced while the other was away, the societas was held .
to be subsisting as regards the duties, but not the rights os the former
until the other had received notice os the withdrawal, ib. 4

§a An agreement that one’s heir should succeed oue as partner
(except in societas vectigalis) was void: ‘adeo morte socii solvitur
societas, ut nec ab initio pa'cisci possimus ut heres etiam succedat
societati' Dig. 17. 2. 59. pr, ib. 35; but the heir, though not a partner,
was bound to complete all business commenced by the deceased, being
herein answerable for culpa lata only, Dig. ib. 35. 36. 4ο. The death ot
one socius dissolved the contractual relation even between 'the rest,
unless it had been otherwise agreed at the outset, ib. 65. 9; but in no
case had it any operation until the other partners had heard oi the
decease, and transactions entered into by them between the death and
notice ol it were transactions oi the firm, ib. 65. 10.

The two higher kinds oi capitis deminutio had the same effect on
societas as death: ‘dicitur et capitis deminutione solvi societatem, quia ·
civili ratione capitis deminutio morti aequiparari dicitnr: sed si adhuc
consentiant in societatem, nova videtur incipere societas' Gaius iii. 153,
‘societas quemadmodum ad heredes socii non transit, ita nec ad ad·
rogatorem, ne alioquin invitus quis socius efficiatur cui non velit: ipse
autem adrogatus socius permanet, narn etsi filiusfamilias emancipatus
suerit, permanebit socius' Dig. 17. a. 65. 11.

§ 6. So too a societas was dissolved by the object sor which it was
formed proving unattainable, Dig. ib. 58. pr.
