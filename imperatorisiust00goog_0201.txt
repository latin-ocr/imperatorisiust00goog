12 Ferae igitur bestiae et volucres et pisces, id est omnia
animalia, quae in terra mari caelo nascuntur, simulatque ab
aliquo capta fuerint, iure gentium statim illius esse incipiunt:
quod enim ante nullius est, id naturali ratione occupanti con-
ceditur. nec interest, ieras bestias et volucres utrum in suo

Bk. iv. 6. 4 inf.) no less than against the rest of the world, the transieree‚
as bonafide possessor, has the actio Publiciana ior the recovery ot' the
property ii taken out oi his hands. Other cases of ‘bonitarian' owner·
ship, though less common than this, sprang up from the praetorian legal
innovations, eg. those ol praetorian universal succession in bankruptcy
and upon death: in these the proper remedy was some other fictitious
action (Gaius iv. 35).

ln the time oi Gaius this distinction between dominium ex iure Quiri·
tium and inbonis habere is of every-day occurrence, but, except in
respect os manumission (note on Bk. i. 5. 1 supr.), the differences between
them are not os any practica} importance. When Justinian had abolished
the old points os difference between solum Italicum and solum pro-
vinciale (Tit. 6 pr. ini, Cod. 7. 313 5. r 3. 15), and peregrini had practi-
cally become unknown, all these refinements disappeared: there was
but one dominium lelt; the only contrast was between it and possessio.
The survival of the actio Publiciana in the Corpus iuris is explained by
Mr. Poste, Gaius p. 188.

Some oi the modes in which ownership is acquired in res singulae are
common to most systems ol law: others are peculiar to this people or
that. The former the Romans supposed to have been prescribed or
sanctioned by the law of nature, and therefore to be prior in time
(vetustius ius) to those which are peculiar: for a peculiar mode oi ac·
quisition exists only in virtue of municipal law or custom, which is itsels
the outcome of political society, and political associatiou was preceded
in their view (derived from the Stoics, p. 36 supr.) by ages in which
nature’s was the only law, and civitates, magistratus, and leges had not
yet come into existence. Itis hardly necessary to observe that this
view is quite erroneous: the history oi Roman law alone might con-
vince us that among primitive peoples absolute private ownership isa
thing at first unknown, and that when it has been developed, alienation
is the exception, not the rule, and the modes in which it is effected
t'ormal and essentially ‘iuris civilis!
