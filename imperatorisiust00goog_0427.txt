414 INSTITUTIONIM LIBRI QUATTUOR. [Lib. lli.

⁷causa habet cum eo mandati iudicium. Graece fideiussor
plerumque ita accipitur: τῇ ἐμῇ πίστει κελεύω, λέγω, θέλω sive

βούλομαιι sed et si φημί dixerit, pro eo erit, ac si dixerit λέγω.
8111 stipulationibus fideiussorum sciendum est generaliter hoe

produced him within a time fixed by the judge, he could be sued
himself.

The modes in which a fideiussor's liability was terminated are

(1) Extinction of the principal debt in any os the modes enumerated it
Tit. ²9 and notes int, Dig. 46. 3. 43; 12. 28. 1; 34. 3. 5. pr. lt is only
under very exceptional circumstances that the suretyremains bound alter
the principa} obligation has ceased to exist. Even where he himself had
brought about its extinction by rendering its periomrance impossible, the
jurists at first were unable to admit the continuance 01 his own liability
ex contractu, though they held him liable to the actio de dolo, Dig. 4. 3
19: but later a utilis actio ex stipulatu was allowed in lieu 01 this, which
eventually became directa: in other words, the continuing liability was
recognised So too it the principal debtor died, leaving no successor,
the surety remained bound, Dig. 46. 3. 95. 5, 6011841. 1. li the cre·
ditor was unable to sue the principal with any effect, because, though the
obligatio was not extinguished, the latter could always repel him by an
exceptio, the surety was usually able to use that exceptio himself, lor the
reason stated in Blc iv. 14. 4 ins. Among the defences or' this class
which he could use are exceptio pacti, loc. cit: ‘exceptio iuris iurandi'
Dig. 12. 2. 28. 1, and the plea ol prescription. The following exceptiones,
however, though open to the debtor, were not also open to the surety:
(a) those which were purely personal to the fonner, Dig. 44. 1. 7. pr.;
e. g. ‘beneficii competentiae' Dig. loc. cit, ‘pacti de non petendo in
personam' Dig. 2. 14 22, ‘nisi bonis cesserit’ Bk iv. 14. 4. inl: the last
ior the very reason that ‘is qui alios pro debitore obligat hoc maxime
prospicit, ut cum facultatibus lapsus suerit debitor, possit ab iis, quos pro
eo obligavit, suum consequi :' the very end of suretyship would otherwise
be defeated Similarly, if the principal debtor was a minor, and could
plead that he had been in integrum restitutus, the fideiussor was not
benefited if the creditor had taken him sor the express purpose oi pro·
tecting himself against this eventuality, Dig. 4. 4. 13. pr. (b) Such ex·
ceptions as left a naturalis obligatio still subsisting, e. g. that SC¹. Mace·
doniam, unless the surety had regressus against the principal debtor,
Dig. 14. 6. 9. 3.

(2) Confusio, or concurrente of the main and accessory liability in the
same person: ‘generaliter lulianus ait eum, qui heres extitit ei pro quo
intervenerat, liberari ex causa accessionis et solummodo quasi heredem
rei teneri’ Dig. 46. 1. 5.

(3) lf the principa! debtor fraudulently evaded his obligation, or squan·
dered his means, the fideiussor could demand his release, Dig. 17.1. 3&
r, Cod. 4. 35. ro.
