aLex est, quod populus Romanus senatore magistratu inter·
rogante, veluti consule, constituebat. plebiscitum est, quod
plebs plebeio magistratu interrogante, veluti tribuno, con-
stituebat. plebs autem a populo eo differt, quo speciesa
genere: nam appellatione populi universi cives significantur
connumeratis etiam patriciis et senatoribus: plebis autem
appellatione sine patriciis et senatoribus ceteri cives signi·
ficantur. sed et plebiscita lege Hortensia lata non minus
svalere quam leges coeperunt. Senatus consultum est, quod
senatus iubet atque constituit. nam cum auctus est populus
Romanus in eum modum, ut difficile sit in unum eum con·
vocare legis sanciendae causa, aequum visum est senatum
ttvice populi consuli. Sed et quod principi placuit, legis habet
vigorem, cum lege regia, quae de imperio eius lata est, populus

(Austin, lect. 29); they were taken quite literally, the former indicating
law which in its very origin was embodied in writing; thus, as is said in
this section, the praetors edict was ius seriptum, even when based, as
it not unsrequently was, on immemorial custom.

§4 Properly, lex is a statute made in the comitia centuriata, plebis·
citum one made in the comitia tributa: for explanation ol these terms see
General Introd. pp. 7-11, 23-25, supr. After the lex Hortensia, however,
plebiscita were frequently called leges, e. g. Dig. 9. 2. 1. 1 (‘ lex Aquilia
plebiscitum est, quum eam Aquilius tribunus a plebe rogaverit '). Later
still senatus-consulta were called leges (e. g. SC. Macedonianum in Dig.
¹4· 6. 9. 4), and finally the term was applied to imperial constitutions:
⁴ quodcunque imperator statuit, legem esse constat’ The false view ol
the relations of populus and plebs which this section gives is noted by
Mr. Poste on Gaius i. 3, cl. General Introd. pp. 7 sq, supr. Tbe
words ‘et senatoribus’ were apparently inserted in those ol Gaius by
Justinian, for the earlier writer must have remembered that plebeians
elected to the senate remainedplebeians still, while in the latter’s time the
plebs was probably conceived as a rabble, and the patriciate wasa
dignity higher even than that of senator, Cod. 12. 3. 3.

ξ 5. For senatus-consulta see General Introd. p. 4ο sq, supr.

§d For the lex regia see General Introd. p. 42, supr.; cs. Cic. de
Republ. ii. 13, 17, 18, and 20: Tacitus, Hist. i. 47, ii. 55, iv. 3, 6.

The general term employed to denote law made by the emperor in
virtue of the lex regia is constitutiones; he is not said iubere, like the
populus and plebs (Gaius i. 3), but decernere, censere, constituere, like
other magistrates ; and in Dig. ςα 16. 120 even prudentes are said ‘iura
constituere! At first such ordinances seem to have been regarded as
differing from the edicta ol the old republican magistrates only in their
trequency and in the binding soree which they possessed for all other
