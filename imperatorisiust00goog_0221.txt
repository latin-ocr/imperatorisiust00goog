stipulationibus id efficere debet. potest etiam in testamento

pactio et stipulatio was the sole mode of contractually creating servi·
tudes of every kind.

There is much difference of opinion as to whether, in addition to the
pactio et stipulatio, a quasi-traditio of the right was required to endow
it with the full proportions of a servitude. Gaius expressly says (ii. 28)
that servitudes, like res incorporales in general, do not admit of traditio ;
but if the latter be conceived as the granting of the physical control over
a res, or as the pennitting it to be enjoyed, servitudes will also admit
of this figurative operation, and accordingly many hold that as boni-
tarian ownership at least could always he conveyed by traditio proper,
so pactio et stipulatio required the supplement of this quasi- or figura·
tive traditio to gain full praetorian protection for the right created, asa
‘real' right. For instance, itis affirmed that this traditio gave a quasi-
possession, entitling the recipient to use the Publician action, as wellas
the actio confessoria, whereby he was exempted from the onus of proving
his transferor's title, and which availed also against non-owners of the
praedium serviens. lt is quite certain that in many passages (e. g. Dig.
6. 2.11.r;7. 1. 25.7;7.4. 1.pr.;7.6.3;8. 1. 20)traditio is specified
as a mode of creating servitudes ; but obviously it must have been pre·
ceded by agreement, and the question is whether a real right could be
created by the latter unsupplernented by the former. There is no pas·
sage in the authorities which affirms the necessity of traditio, and the
prevailing view now seems to be that it was not essential; though the
contrary is still maintained by some who argue from the jural impossi-
bility of creating real rights by a contract ‘in the proper sense of the
term,' and explain the absence of passages affirming the necessity of
traditio by the consideration that in the time of the classical jurists
servitudes were, iure civili, not thus created at all.

The other modes in which servitudes in general could originate are 2—-

(1) Testamentary disposition or legacy; this was commonest in per·
sonal servitudes, especially usufruct, which could either be bequeathed ’
directly (Tit. 4. r inf), or the heir could he directed to create it in favour
of the legatee: ‘ususfructus uniuscuiusque rei legari potest, et aut ipso
iure constituetur aut per heredem praestabitur: ex causa damnationis
per heredem praestabitur, ipso iure per vindicationem’ Paul. sent. rec. 3
6. 17. Bequest of praedial servitudes, to be duly constituted by the heir,
is spoken of in this section ; cf. Dig. 8. 4 163 33. 3.

(2) Deductio; reservation of the servitude in conveying the dominium
either inter vivos or by will; Tira 1 inf, Dig. 8. 2. 34 and 35; 8. 3.
30 and 33.

(3) Judicial decision, either (a) byadiudicatio in a iudicium divisorium,
Bk. iv. 6. 20 ; ib. 17. 4 and 5 inf.; (b) declaring a servitude duly consti·
tuted as against a recalcitrant defendant who refuses to create it him·
self ; or (c) reviving by ‘in integrum restitutio' a servitude which has
been lost, Dig. 8. 5. 8. 4.

(4) ln certain cases usufruct arose ipso iure in virtue of statutory
euactment (lex); e. g. the pater’s usufruct iu the peculium adventitium
