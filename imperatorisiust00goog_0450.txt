against B under the contract unless or until he had an interest in the
proper performance of the act undertaken: ‘mandati actio tunc com·
petit, curn coepit interesse eius qui mandavit: ceterum si nihil interest,
cessat mandati actio, et eatenus competit quatenus interest' Dig. 17. 1.
8. 6. This seems to he contradicted by 6. 4 in the same Title: ‘si tibi
mandavero quod mea non intererat, veluti ut pro Seio intervenias vel ut
Titio credas, erit mihi tecum mandati actio, ut Celsus scribit, et egotibi
s'um obligatus! The explanation, as Dr. Walker observes (Selected
Titles from the Digest‚ Introduction to part 1,), is ‘that a mandate at the
time it is given may be aliena tantum gratia, but that it must become
mandantis gratia also before it can be sued up0n; and it may become
mandantis gratia in two ways. ln the first place, this may be the result
of the mandatarius beginning to act, for he thus turns h'is mandator into
a negotiorum gestor of the benefited party; ie. he makes him an un·
solicited intermeddler with another’s affairs ; and a negotiorum gestor is
answerable to the stranger for any mismanagement or loss. Hence,
frorn the moment the mandatarius begins to act, the mandator, by
reason of his own liability to the stranger, has an interest sufficient to
found a right of action against the mandatarius Secondly, the stranger,
because of his knowledge of the mandate having been given, supposing
he hears ufir, may abstain from executing his own business, so that the
non-performance or faulty performance of the mandate may do him hurt3
and for this, as traceable to the action of the mandator, he can, as before,
hold the mandator responsible in his capacity of a negotiorum gestor!

§b By the civilians this is called mandatum qualificatum. ff Α
advised or requested (mandavit) B to give credit to C, i. e. either to
enter into a eontraet with him (as to lend him money, 6 inf), whereby
he became his creditor, or to defer suing upon a debt already owed
him by C(Dig.17. 1.12.14), A was taken to warrant C's honesty and
solvency, and became answerable to B by actio mandati, if the latter
took his advice or complied with his request, that the debt should be
discharged; and this even though B would have lent the money, or
deferred the suit, in any case. Thus in effect a contract of suretyship
can be made by means of amandatum, which in this form is usually co·
ordinated in the Corpus iuris with fideiussio (Dig. 46. r, Cod. 8. 41, de
fideiussoribus et mandatoribus) ε cf. Dig. 17. 1. 32 ‘in summa quicunque
contractus tales sunt, ut quicunque eorum nomine fideiussor obligari
possit, et mandati obligationem consistere puto: nequeenim multum
referre, praesens quis interrogatus fideiubeat, an absens mandet!

The peculiarities of mandatum as a form of suretyship are due to the
