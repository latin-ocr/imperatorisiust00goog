lilius genitus fuerit, exheres esto! Postumorum autem 10c02
sunt et hi, qui in sui heredia locum succedendo quasi adgna-
scendo fiunt parentibus sui heredes. ut ecce si quis filium et
ex eo nepotem neptemve in potestate habeat, quia filius gradu .
praeceditis solus iura sui heredis habet, quamvis nepos quo-
que et neptis ex eo in eadem potestate sunt: sedsi filiuseius ¹
vivo eo moriatur aut qualibet alia ratione exeat de potestate ’
eius, incipit nepos neptisve in eius locum succedere et eo modo
iura suorum heredum quasi adgnatione nanciscuntur. ne ergo

eo modo rumpatur eius testamentum, sicut ipsum filium vel
heredem instituere vel nominatim exheredare debet testator,
ne non iure iaciat testamentum, ita et nepotem neptemve ex
filio necesse est ei vei heredem instituere vel exheredare, ne
forte vivo eo filio mortuo, succedendo in locum eius nepos
neptisve quasi adgnatione rumpant testamentum. idque lege
Iunia Velleia provisum est, in qua simul exheredationis modus
ad similitudinem postumorum demonstratur. Emancipatoss

the authority ol the jurist Salvius Julianus: see Poste's Gaius pp. 236-7.

For those who were in postumomm loco by adrogation or adoption
the laur was not so simple. Gaius says (ii. 138-140) that a will was
avoided by the subsequent adoption ola suus heres, even it the latter
was instituted heir in it: but this doctrine was disputed by Scaevola
(Dig. 28. 3. 28) and Papinian (Dig. 28. 2. ²3· 1), whose view was adopted
by Justinian, Dig. ib. 6. pr. On the other hand, is an extraneus was
disinherited in a will, and then was subsequently adopted or adrogated
hythe testator, the will was always avoided, Dig. 324 8. 8 (‘ exheredatio
res in 22122220 inepta est ³). The only exception to this was where a
son who bad been emancipated or given in adoption was disinherited,
aud subsequently adrogated or readopted by his own natural father, the
testator, Dig. 28. 2. 23· pr. Probably tbe same rules applied to the
postumus snus by legitimation: his institution in a previously executed
will saved it, his exheredation did not.

lt the son ol a filiusfamilias who had made a will ol castrense pecu·
lium was not therein instituted or disinberited, and then became suus
heres by the grandfathers death, the will was avoided, Dig. 28. 2. 28. 2.

ln Ulpian’s time it was not established that all male postumi sui must
be disinherited noniinatim, though he says (reg. 22. 22) that none in a
remotes degree than the first was disinherited inter ceteros, it was neces·
sary to give him a legacy lor the same reason alleged in this aennon, in
respect α’ postumae suae: bnt he adds, sed tutius est nominatim eos
uberedari, et id obsmvatur magis
