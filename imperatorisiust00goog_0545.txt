532 INSTITUTIONUM LIBRI QUATTUOR. [Lib. lv.

oposita est. Rursus ex diverso si quis, cum rei publicae causa
abesset vel in hostiurn potestate esset, rem eius qui in civitate
esset usu ceperit, permittitur domino, si possessor rei publicae
causa abesse desierit, tunc intra annum rescissa usucapione
earn petere, id est ita peterent dicat possessorem usu non
cepisse et ob id suam esse rem. quod genus actionis et aliis
quibusdam simili aequitate motus praetor accommodat, sicut
ex latiore digestorum seu pandectarum volumine intellegere
6licet. Item si quis in fraudem creditorum rem suam alicui
tradiderit, bonis eius a creditoribus ex sententia praesidis
possessis permittitur ipsis creditoribus rescissa traditione eam
rem petere, id est dicere earn rem traditam non esse et ob id

(5. ln the ease here supposed the title conferred by a completed
usucapion is rescinded or cancelled by in integrum restitutio (note on ξ 33
ini), and the plaintifi establishes his right by an ordinary vindicatio or
Publiciana according to the precise nature ol his interest: the assumption
by some writers oi an independent action (rescissoria or contraria Publi-
cianae) has no foundation. The text speaks only of protection against
an absent person; but the principle was applied equally in favour oi
those whose property, wlu'le they were absent rei publicae causa, had
been acquired per usucapionem, Dig. 4. 6. 23 3 ; 43. 1. 15. pr. ; cf. the
note on in integrum restitutio,§ 33 ini. For the old annus utilis Justinian
substituted in all cases a quadriennium continuum, Cod. a 53 7. The
references at the end of the paragraph are to Dig. 4. 6. 1. 1 ; ib. 21. pr. ;

56. The iusta causans the in integrum restitutio in this case is the dolus
ol the alienee, and the creditors’ action, as seems clear from the text, is
in rem: though it is difficult to see why aster restitutio there was
any necessity ior a fiction: ci. Bk. iii. 10.3 and notes supr. Whether
the action (as Theophilus says) was called Pauliana is disputed: it is
certain that there wasa personal action oi the same name, and lying
under similar circumstances. So iar as can be elicited from the
authorities, it seems probahle that the creditors had, as against iraudu-
lent alienation by the debtor (including wrongsul payment of one or
some of them in full when he was aware oi his insolvency) (1) an actio
Pauliana in personam, Dig. 22. 1. 38.4 (2) an interdictum fraudatorium,
Dig. 36 1. 67. 1 (3) an actio in sactum available against a bona fide
alienee, Dig. 42. 8. ro. pr. (4) the in integrum restitutio mentioned in
the text, with a view to a real action (Pauliana i). The relation between
these remedies, and the precise purpose sor which they were respectively
employed, are so variously represented by the commentators that it is
impossible here to go further into the question. For the missio in
possessionem oi creditors upon their debtors' insolvency see p. 376 supr.
