Tit. 6,] DE USUCAPIONIBUS, ET C. 217

est, ut res quidem mobiles per triennium usucapiantur, immo·
biles vero per longi temporis possessionem, id est inter prae·
sentes decennio, inter absentes viginti annis usucapiantur et
his modis non solum in Italia, sed in omni terra, qu'ae nostro
imperio gubernatur, dominium rerum iusta causa possessionis
praecedente adquiratur.

non-owner sells and delivers property, the purchaser, besides this causa
(pro empto) must not know that it belongs to some one other than the
vendor, or that the vendor has no authority to sell; ‘bonae fidei emptor
esse videtur, qui ignoravit eam rem alienam esse, aut putavit eum, qui
vendidit, ius vendendi habere, puta procuratorem aut tutorem esse' Dig.
50. 16. 109. By Roman law bona fides was required only at the incep-
tion of possession, and in sales also at the time oi the contract: under
the canon and modern civil law it is different.

(4) The possession must continue uninterruptedly during the period
fixed by law3 in caseos interruption (usurpatio) the whole time must
commence and run again. The time required by the Twelve Tables
was two years sor acquisition of immoveables, one sor that oi moveables.

The exclusion of provincial soil from the operation ol usucapio led
indirectly to very considerable changes in the law. The ground upon
which Justinian tells us usucapio was recognised—ne rerum dominia in
incerto essent—was as real a one in the provinces as in ltaly; and in
them its place was taken by an analogous praetorian institution, longi >
temporis praescriptio or possessio, By this, it a man possessed land sor
ten years (or twenty, it the owner lived out ot' the province), the latter’s
action lor its recovery could, after the lapse ol that period, be defeated
bya plea (called originally praescriptio, later exceptio) alleging the length
ol the defendant's possession. The rules already stated as to iusta
causa and bona fides, and the positive enactments excluding certain
things from this mode oi acquisition, were applied here as well as
in usucapio; and there is evidence that by this new institution res
mobiles could be acquired (by peregrini) as wellas land. lt operated
at first, as it were, as a Statute of Limitation only, but eventually it
conferred ownership, the longi temporis possessor being allowed to
bring a real action ior the recovery of the object is deprived os it; see
Cod. 7. 39. 8. pr.

When Justinian became emperor, the law oi Prescription in his
dominions consisted really oi two heterogeneous portions. Res mobiles
could be acquired by the old civil law usucapio in a year; but prac-
tically all the soil oi the Eastem Empire was ‘ provincial,' so that the
old biennii usucapio had no application; its place was supplied by the
praetorian longi temporis possessio oi ten or twenty years. Justinian
reformed the old law as follows: (t) he did away with theold legal dis-
tinction between Italian and provincial soil; (a) altered the periods oi
time required, as stated in this sectiou, three years instead oi one being
now necessary for the usucapio of res mobiles; and (3) upon the
