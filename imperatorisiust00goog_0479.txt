realized was the claim of another person. This cessio nominum
or actionum, as it was called, though it dispensed with the necessity
of the debtor's assent, was not only rude, but faulty, especially if
made for valuable consideration. The appointment of C, as A's
procurator, was govemed hythe usual mles of mandatum, and con·
sequently became void (Ble iii. 26. 9 and ro) if before action brought
either assignor or assignee died, or if the former revolred his com·
mission; there was no legal relation between assignee and debtor
until litis contestatio had been reached in proceedings taken hythe
former. At length this was obviated by the assignee's being allowed
to sue, not in the assignor’s name, but in his own by actio utilis
(Dig. 3. 3. 55, Cod. 4. 15. ult, 6. 37. 18), which he was enabled by
gradual changes to do not only where he had been expressly ap·
pointed agent, but also in cases of a mere alienatory disposition.
It is disputed whether the effect ol the change was to make the
assignee sole creditor, or whether, in relation to the debtor‚ he did
not still legally continue a mere agent, enforcing by action in his own
name the right of another ; in other words, whether a genuine assign-
ment, by which the assignee simply and actually stepped into the
shoes of his assignor, who simultaneously dropped altogether out of
the matter, was recognised at any time in Roman law. This,
however, is too minute and complicated a question to he entered
upon.

For such assignment no form was prescribed. It could be effected
(ι) hy any expression of intention, unless it was of such a legal cha·
racter as to be invalid unless accompanied by certain solemnities (c. g.
donatio, p. 224 supr.); (albyjudicial sentence, e.g.in an actio familiae
erciscundae, Dig. ro. a. 3. If a defendant were ordered to transfer
achose in action, the judge might add that unless the order were
obeyed the assignment should be taken to have actually been made;
(3) in pursuance of a general rule of law (cessio legis), eg. a person
who procures the rescission of a will by querella inofficiosi can
recover legacies paid by the testamentary heir, Dig. 5. a.8.16;
19.r.13.a5.

The following rules of assignment are deserving of notice, if only
for the close parallelism between some ol them and those of English
law:

(1) Until the debtor has received notice of the assignment, he is at
liberty to treat the assignor as his true creditor; thus he is released
by payment to him (‘ ille, cuius nomen tibi pignori datum est, nisi ei
cui debuit solvit nondum certior a te de obligatione tua factus,
