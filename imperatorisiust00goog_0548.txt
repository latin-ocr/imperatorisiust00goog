quaeritur, an ei pecunia debeatur, sed an iuraverit. Poenales 12
quoque actiones bene multas ex sua iurisdictione introduxit:
veluti adversus eum qui quid ex albo eius corrupisset: et in
eum qui patronum vel parentem in ius vocasset, cum id non
impetrasset: item adversus eum, qui vi exemerit eum quiin
ius vocaretur, cuiusve dolo alius exemerit: et alias innume-
rabiles. Praeiudiciales actiones in rem esse videntur, quales ta
sunt, per quas quaeritur, an aliquis liber vel an libertus sit,
vel de partu agnoscendo. exquibus sere una illa legitimam
causam habet, per quam quaeritur, an aliquis liber sit:
ceterae ex ipsius praetoris iurisdictione substantiam capiunt.

could not go: ‘non aliud quaeritur quam an iuratum sit' Dig. 12. 2. 5.· 2.
The mode in which the oath was used was by the plaintiff demanding oi
his adversary in the initial stage of the proceedings (in iure, in the
formulary period) whether he would swear that the claim had no founda-
tion; ir he did so, he was protected by the exceptio iurisiurandi from
further litigation : but tr, without being prepared to go sofar as this, he
challenged the plaintiff to swear rothe justice os his claim, and the
latter did so, he was debaned from denying his liability; is he refused
to discharge it, he could be brought to bay by the actio in sactum re·
serred to in the text.

ᾗ 12. The praetors edicts and orders seem, like the leges (Dion. Halic.
R. Α. 3. 36), to have been engraved on tablets of oak, which were then
whitened over and exposed to public view. Subsequentiy other materials
were used: ‘in albo, vel in charta, vel in alia materia' Dig. 2. 1. 7. pr,
but the name album was retained. Albi corruptio is used in a wide
sense: ‘isqui album raserit, corruperit, sustulerit, mutaverit, quidve
aliud propositum edicendi causa turbaverit, extra ordinem punietur'
Paul. sent. rec. 1. 13a. 3. For the action os a patron against his sreed·
man sor suing him without first obtaining the praetor’s permission (Tit 16.
3 int) see Gaius iv. 46, which also refers to the penal actio in sactum
‘contra eum qui vi exemerit eum qui in ius vocatur ε’ sor the latter cf.
also Dig. 2. 7. Among the ‘alias innumerabiles' are the actions men-
tioned in Tit. 5 supr, and ξ 25 inf.

513. For praejudicial actions under the system ol formulae see Ex·
cursus X int. Their object is merely to judicially ascertain sacts which
are oi legal importance‚ or the existence oi alleged legal relations, eg. a
man’s status or patemity, the amount of a dos (Gaius iv. 44), whethera
woman is married or not, Dig. 25. 3. 3 4, whether the provisions oi this
or that enactment have been complied with (e. g. the lex Cicereia, Gaius
iii. 123. p. 411 supr), etc. Hence the name praeiudicia; the decision
forms or mayform the basis oi subsequent litigation. As they do not
result in condemnation, but merely in apronunciatio, they are sometimes
said to be iudicia, but not actiones (e. g. Dig. 3. 3. 35. 2); Justinian says
