· EXCURSUS III.

POSSESSION.

Possmsrou must be conceived as distinct from ownership or do·
minium. In most cases, of course, the two are conjoined: the owner
bas possession of his property. Oiten, however, they are separated:
the landlord owns the soil which his tenant possesses: his solicitor
hss possession of the title-deeds to his estates: the findet of property
possesses it, though another is its owner: and numberless other cases
will at once occur in which the owner and the possessor of a thing
are different persons. But (it may be argued) though this is so, yet
the relation of a person to a thing which he possesses is immaterial
sor purposes of law: the law recognises no rights less then that of
ownership or its fragments. Because I happen to have found abanlr
note, and then lose it again, I cannot recover it from the second
finder: possession in itself is not a legal right at all. If this were the
cnse, law-books would be spared one of their most difficult chapters;
but, asa matter of fact, all legal systema treat possession, under certain
circumstances, as a right, distinct from and independent of ownership,
and guarantee it protectior„ It remeius to· see what, under Roman
law, those circumstances are.

Mete possession, in itself‚ is no right at all. A person ‘merely’
possesses who has the physical power of dealing with a tangible
object to the exclusion of every one else, and is aware of such power.
Of such a relation between person and thing, by itself, the law takes
uo notice3 but being the foundation of all legally recognised posses·
sion it requires to be caresully noted. Very frequently it is called
naturalis possessio (e. g. Dig. 41. a. r. 1), but itis also denoted by the
expressions, custodia (Dig. 3⁶· 4. 5. pn), in possessione esse (Bk. iv.
15. 5 inf), tenere (Dig. 41· 2. 24), naturaliter possidere (Dig. ib. ra. r).
We shall call it uniformly Detention For examples of persons who
badonlyDetention, as distinct from possession proper (e. g. the slave,
filiusfamilias, agent, borrower, lessee, and depositary) reference may
be made to Mr. Poste’s Gaius, pp. 641-645. The idea of Detention
is limited to certain classes of objects. Nothing can be ‘detained'

(and therefore, as we shall see, possessed) which is not corporea13
