332 INTRODUCTION TO BOOK ΙΙΙ.

theone is entitled to claim an act or forbearance lrorn the other. The
one, or creditor, has a right in personam, the other, or debtor, owes
to him a relative duty; both right and duty are conceived as obliga·
tiones, or as correlative parts ol a single obligatio; but it is the right,
or creditor side, alone which is a res incorporalis, and owing to which
this department ol law salls under the head oi ‘res' at all.

This is not so clear and above doubt as never to have been
questioned. The position ol obligations between the law ol Inherit·
ance and the law ol Actions has led Hugo and others to regard them
as a portion ol the latter rather than ol the ius quod ad res pertinen
a theory to some extent countenanced by the lact thatin the Digest
(de obligationibus et actionibus, 44. 7) and Code (4. ro) actions and
obligations are treated together, and hythe technical meaning ol
‘actio' as action in personam, in contrast with ‘petitio' or action in
rem, Dig. 44. 7. 28 ; 50. 16.178. a. It has even been attempted to
support this view by a statement ol Theophilus in his commentary on
Tit. 13. pr. ol this book, where he says, ‘Now that we have spoken
ol persons and os things, we ought logically to treat ol actions ; but
this arrangement, ie. the treating ol obligations first, is not inexcus-
able, lor in discussing obligations one is implicitly discussing actions
also, ol which they are the mothers! But it is clear from his remarks
on Bk. iv. 6. pn, that Theophilus is preferring a lourlold division ol'
the law, making obligationes a fourth and independent department
intermediate between res and actiones; and this cannot convince us
that Justinian in his institutes intended to depart from the arrange·
ment ol Gaius: lor although, had we the Institutas alone, a reason-
able suspicion might be justified by the lact that obligations are partly
treated in the third book, which no one doubts begins with res, and
partly in the fourth, which no one doubts ends with actiones, yet this
is removed by our knowledge that Gaius concludes the subject ol
obligations in his third book, and devotes the whole ol the lourth to
actions. Indeed, the enumeration ol obligations among res incorpo-
rates in Bk. ii. 2. a, is sufficient prool in itsell ol the wrongness of
Hugo’s theory.

The acts or events which give rise to this kind ol legal relation
called obligatio are ol course different homone another in character,
but they may be grouped with tolerable correctness in two principal
and two subordinate classes. One ol the former, which is prominent
in all developed systems ol law, is agreement; the other is delict,
which may bere be defined with sufficient accuracy as wrong other

than breach ol contract. But there are obligations which take their
