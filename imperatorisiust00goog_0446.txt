Titus] DE SOCIETATE. 433

quoque distrahi societatem manifestum est, scilicet si universa
bona socii publicentur: nam cum in eius locum alius succedit,
pro mortuo habetur. Item siquis ex sociis mole debiti prae-8
gravatus bonis suis cesserit et ideo propter publica aut
propter privata debita substantia eius veneat, solvitur societas.
sed hoc casu si adhuc consentiant in societatem, nova vide·
tur incipere societas. Socius socio utrum eo nomine tantum9
teneatur pro socio actione, si quid dolo commiserit, sicut is
qui deponi apud se passus est, an etiam culpae, id est desidiae
atque neglegentiae nomine, quaesitum est: praevaluit tamen
etiam culpae nomine teneri cum. culpa autem non ad ex·
arctissimam diligentiam dirigenda est: sufficit enim talem
diligentiam in communibus rebus adhibere socium, qualem

damnati pars tertia bonorum ex lege Iulia publicatur' Dig. 48. 7. 1. pr. ;
when total (the only case in which it extinguished societas) it did so only
by producing one ol the two higher kinds of capitis deminutio, and so is
not a distinct mode of termination : ‘damnatione bona publicantur cum
aut vita adimitur aut civitas, aut servilis condicio irrogatur' Dig. 48. 20. 1.
The ‘alius' who succeeds ‘universally’ is the fiscus, Dig. 46. t. 71. pr.

t 8. For cessio bonorum see p. 377 supr. Societas could be dissolved,
besides the modes mentioned in the text, (ι) by lapse os the time for
which it was originally formed, Dig. 17. 2. 1. pr. ; ib. 65. 6. Where per-
sons had become partners ior a definite term neither could withdraw
during it except on a reasonable ground, Dig. ib. 14-16, in the absence
os which it was open to the other to treat the partnership as still sub·
sisting, ib. 65. 6; (2) By division, either voluntary and extrajudicial, or
entorced through action by one of the socii: for the form os this see
next note.

59. The rights and duties os partners inter se are mainly as follow.
Each must contribute the stipulated quota of capital or labour; inability
arising from no fault ot' his own, while exempting him lrom this duty, at
the same time disabled him trorn enforcing it against the rest, Dig. 17. 2.
58. pr. and 1. In detennining what saults were imputable, the standard os
diligentia, as is said in the text, was merely that qualem in suis rebus,
Exc.V1 ins. ; the reason assigned sor this by Justinian being the same as
that which is given in the case of depositum in Tit. 14 3 supr. Between
co·heirs, on the other hand, a higher case was required, ‘quoniam cum
coherede non contrahimus, sed incidimus in eum' Dig. to 2. 25. 16.
tt, however, alter undertaking the conduct ot any particular piece of
partnership business, he len it to a subordinate, he was unconditionally
ansverable tor the latter's shortcomings, Dig. 17. 2. 233 and os such
transactions he must keep accounts and submit thern to the others, ib.
58. pr. and 1. Whatever he acquires sor the societas, or by its means, he
is bound ‘communicare,' i.e. to throw into the common fund, or to give
