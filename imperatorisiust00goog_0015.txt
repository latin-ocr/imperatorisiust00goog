2 INTRODUCTION.

Finally, the legislative worlr ol Justinian will be described with tolerable
lullness, concluding, in particular, with an examination ol the scope
and system of the Institutes.

Of the sorm os the earliest Roman law· it is possible to spealr more
positively than ol its matter and contents. The srrst trace of genuine
legislation is to be found in the Twelve Tables, which the mythical
founding ol the city preceded by more than three hundred years.
During these three centuries, the law· by which the Romans were
governed was unwritten; it was pure custom handed down by tradition
from past generations, and doubtless identical in origin with the usages
ol the primitive Aryan stocln Modern comparative jurisprudence has
established resemblances so striking between the earliest known in·
habitants of Rome, the usages ol the primitive Irish‚ and those os the
Asiatie Aryan peoples which have been most open to observation‚ that
(while admitting that it was modified on every side by such agencies
as climate and the circumstances ol a military people ever in arms) we
must allow that the customary law of Rome, srom which a new de·
parture was taken at the time os the Twelve Tables, was of very great
antiquity, though conjectures as to its age are no less unprofitable
than idle. How the custom was preserved, and protected srorn con·
tamination by foreign elementa, we know lrorn writers on the early

history ol Rome; it was jealously treasured up by the college ol Pon-

tifices, who were the first judges in all matters relating to the samily
and property, and who thereby acquired the title os ‘ guardians of the
“ law3’ ‘omnium tamen harum (legum) et interpretandi scientia et ac-
tiones apud collegium pontificum erant, ex quibus constituebatur, quis
quoque anno praeesset privatis' (Dig. 1. 2. 2. 6).

The statement that there was nothing in the nature ol statute law
until the enactment ol the Twelve Tables may seem to be contradicted
by the existence os the so·called ‘leges regiae,' oi which however we
know little that is certain. ‘Leges quasdam etipse (Romulus) curiatas
ad populum tulit. Tulerunt et sequentes reges, quae omnes conscriptae
extant in libro Sexti Papirii, qui luit illis temporibus . . . ls liber, ut
diximus, appellatur ius civile Papirianum, non quia Papirius de suo
quidquam ibi adiecit. sed quod leges sine ordine latas in unum com-
posuit’ (Pomponius in Dig. 1. a. 2. a). From this it would appear that
Sextus Papirius, who, according to Dionysius (iii. 36), was a pontifex,
made a compilation oi these leges regiae in the reign ol the last ol the
kings. Dionysius also tells us that, alter the expulsion os the lrings‚
Papirius re=established those ol them of which Numa was said to be
the author 3 and we know a commentary to have been written on his
