THE GENERAL NATURE OF OBLIGATIONS. 465

tions only, which, 11 the inferior had a peculium, discharged them·
selves by their operation on the latter, which was automatically
diminished by what he owed the superior, and augmented by what
the superior owed him, Dig 15. r. 9. 0- 4.

10 Β10““ ιιι 09 there' rs a discussion 01 the modes ιιι which obliga·
tions could be extinguished: but this seems the most convenient
place lor briefly descrihing those 10 which they could be trans·
serred. To this question there are two sides3 either the right
may be transferred, or the liability. Transference 01 the liability, 11
by that we understand a transaction which entirely reienses the
person who has hitherto been liable, and imposes the debt on some
one else, could (apart from universal succession) be effected only by
novatio (Blr. iii. ²9· 3), which, when employed for this specific pur·
pose, was called expromissio, or by an actos 0 similar character,
defensio. Transference 01 the right also (except in cases 01001-
versal succession) could at first be ellected only by novatio. This,
however, is not assignment, but substituted agreement 3 the assent
end cooperation 01 the debtor is required, and the right does not
pass from the person entitled to some one else, but is cancelled on
condition 010 new one being created in lavour 01 the latter. The
Romans, in lact, struggled, with a tenacity equalled only by that 01
the English Common Law, against the assignment 01 what we call
choses in action, 1. e. rights in personam; but while the reason
alleged lor his resistance hythe English judge was the evil 01
‘maintenance,' the Romans, with more lawyer-lilre instinct, based
their opposition on the character 01 an obligation as an essentially
00100001 relation, the parties to which could not be changed without
destroying its existence ¹.

A rude species 01 assignment became possible alter the introduc-
11οο 01 the formulary procedure, under which plaintiffs were generally
permitted to conduct their suits through agents (Gaius iv. 80). Ι1
A, creditor against B, debitor, wished to assign his right 10 C, he
could melre the latter his agent, procurator (in rem suam); C therehy
became entitled to accept performance from B, or in desault to sue
him in A’s name, the condemnation being expressed in his own
name (Gaius iv. 86, 87). The result, in the Roman view, was no
transierence 01 the obligation, lorA remained the true and only
creditor; all that passed was the right 01 action, or rather the capacity
to exercise another’s right 01 action, and all that C asserted or
