his socii their fair share, ib. 67. pr.; conversely he can claim to be in·
demnified ior all personal losses aud expenses incurred in partnership
affairs, ib. 38. 1 ; 52. 4, and in societas omniurn bonorum to have all his
debts, except those incurred ex delicto (see p. 429) discharged from
the common property. Losses arising from the insolvency oi one partner
must be divided among all according to the principles stated in §5 1-3
supr. and notes; Dig. 17. 2. 65 53 ib. 67. pr.

The remedy by which partners enforced these duties against one
another was the actio pro socio, condemnation in which entailed infamia,
Bk. iv. 16. 22 ini.; but the defendant could claim beneficium com-
petentiae against the rest, i. e. they were not entitled to take all his
property in satisfaction oi their claims, but must leave him enough to
supply the bare necessities ol iiie, Book iv. 6. 38 int, though Dig. 42. t.
16 (perhaps incorrectly) limits the beneficium to societas omnium bono-
rum. Division ot' the joint property could be compelled by the actio
communi dividundo, Blc iv. 6. ²03 ib. 28; iv. 17. 5 ini.

The question oi the rights os partners against, and their duties towards,
third persons, is a different one. li all the partners together enter into
a contract with some one else, they are entitled and bound in relation to
him in the ratio oi their shares in the lucrum and damnum: ‘si tamen
plures per se navem exerceant, proportionibus exercitionis conveniuntur,
neque invicem sui magistri videntur' Dig. 14, 1. 4. pr, ‘quamvis actio
ex empto cum singulis sit per portione, qua socii luerunt’ Dig. 21. 1. 44.
1. By special agreement such contract may produce an active or passive
correal obligation in favour oi or binding the partums, and where they
are bankers such au obligation results ipso iure from all strictly banking
transactions entered into by any of them: ‘si plures sint qui eandem
actionem habent, unius loco habentur: utputa plures sunt rei stipulandi
vel plures argentarii, quorum nomina simul iacta sunt; unius loco nume·
rabuntur, quia uuum debitum est’ Dig. 2. 14 9. pr. ; ib. 25· pr. ; ib. 27.
liut it the contract is made by one or some only ot' the partners, the
question arises how iar they confer rights and impose obligations on the
rest. lt the transactionis clearly a partnership transaction, the latter
can sue upon it only as assignees, even though it was entered into by
their own express instructions, though they are entitled to a cessio oi
the right os action, which, it necessary, they can compel by judicial
process.

As regards their liabilities, it should be caresutly observed that the
partnership is never conceived as a fictitious person, capable in itself oi
having rights and owing duties, as distinct t'rom the partners3 the latter
cannot claim that business creditors‚ in the event ot' the firm becoming
insolvent, shall limit their demands to the partnership assets, though
they can insist on the latter being proceeded against and exhausted
first, Dig. ¹7· 2. 65. 14- Three cases, in which the contract is not made
by all the partners collectively, need to be distinguished:
