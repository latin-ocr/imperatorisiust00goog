the Republic they could issue edicts, which had a greater validity than

those ol the old annual magistrates, because they held office lor lile:
but in theory their soree died with thena Thus, Dion Cassius (lvi. 28)
mentions a lex ol no. ra, by which it was provided that resolutione
arrived at by Augustus with the advice ol his council should have the
force ol a senatusconsultum. The authority which Angustus pos·
sessed in virtue ol his various offices was conferred on his successore
by separate leges; later, the emperor was invested with his powers
uno ictu, by a lex de imperio, alter the analogy of the lex curiata of
the early legal period, which* also gave his enactments the force of
statutes (Cetius i. 5) and released him t'rom the control ol the laws
(Dion Cassius liii. 18. 28). This lex de imperio is in Inst. i 26
and other passages ol the corpus iuris called lex regia, but it was
probably never so entitled before the third century, when to avoid the
comparison between rex and imperator would have been mere affec·
tation. An important fragment os the lex de imperio ol Vespasiae
(nn. 69) is extant,· it empowers the emperor to conclude alliances,
procure senatus consulta, nominate the magistrates, extend the po·
moerium, and issue enactments with the force ol law. And so abso·
lute did the imperial authority become in the next 150 years, that
Ulpian could, early in the third century, speakos a complete devolution
ol the power ol the people to the emperor: ‘Cum lege, quae de impe·
rio eius lata est, populus ei et in eum omne suum imperium et po·
testatem conlerat' (Dig. 1. 4. 1 pn). The general term used to denote
law made either directly or indirectly by the emperor is constitutiones3
their various kinds are described in a note to Bk. i. a. 6. Alter
Septimius Severus, in whose reign, as has been observed the last os
the senatus consulta was enacted, the whole legislative authority ol
the state concentrated itsell in the hands ol the emperor. Up to
the time ol Constantine, however, the emperors legislated with
reference to specific cases ol litigation, by decreta and rescripta,
lar more than by direct and merely prospective enactmeot ; and
such changes as were thus made in the law were lar less compre-
hensive than those made by leges and senatus consulta. The period
in which direct imperial legislation was most active had yet to
come.

The distinction between the ius civile and the ius praetorium in no
way ceased with the introduction os the empire, but rather became
emphasised. Even had the office ol praetor been suppressed, and the
edictum perpetuum ceased to appear, the development ol the praeto·
rian law, in its peculiar character as a liberal and equitable system,
