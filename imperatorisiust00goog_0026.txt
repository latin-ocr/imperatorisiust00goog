THE T WELVE TABLES. 13

last hint was taken, afler an interval of ten years, by the patricians;
they consented (ac. 451) that the powers of consuls and tribunes
should for a while be suspended, and the whole authority of the
state entrusted to ten commissionem, on whom was imposed the. rask
of codifying the public and private law of Rome. In that same year
they submitted to the people a code often tables, which, along with
two tables added in the following year, were accepted, as genuine
statute law, by the comitia. These were the celebrated Twelve
Tables, described by Livy as ‘corpus omnis Romani iuris: and ‘fons
publici privatique iuris3' as ‘finis aequi iuris’ by Tacitus, though in
reality not so much ‘linis' as a fresh staning-potnt for a new and
vigorous legal development. ‘Placuit publica auctoritate decem con·

stitui viros, per quos peterentur leges a Graecis civitatibus, et civitas ·

fundaretur legibus, quas in tabulas eboreas (ἓ) perscriptas pro rostris
composuerunt, ut possint leges apertius percipi, datumque est eis
ius eo anno in civitate summum, uti leges et corrigerent, si opus
esset, et interpretarentur, neque provocatio ab eis, sicut a reliquis
magistratibus lieret Et ita ex accedenti appellatae sunt leges duodecim
tabularum, quarum ferendarum auctorem fuisse decemviris Hermodo-
rum quendam Ephesium, exulantem in Italia, quidam retulerunt'
(Pomponius in Dig. 1. a. a. 3 and 4).

The allusion to the Ephesian Hermodorus contained in this pas·
sage, and the reference (which is confirmed by older writers, eg.
Livy ii‘n 31, 32, Servius iu Verg. Aen. vii. 695) to embassies sent to
Greece to search out the laws of her eides, and especially those which
Solon had given to Athens, have led many historians to believe that a
large proportion of the decemviral legislatiou was derived from foreign
sources, and some even to suppose that the whole of it, in substance,
was Greelr law. It would seem thatin point of fact no theory was
ever wider of the truth; the conservatism of the decemviri is not their
least remarkable feature to which their laws bear witness. The
foreign influence was trifling‚ and left no traces whatever on the
private portion of the code; what changes the decemviri made in
pre-existing law seem to have been dictated by a sound liberal spirit,
and bya conviction that it was idle to attempt to evade the ine'vitable,
the eventual exaequatio juris, or equalisation of the two orders in the
state. In such portioris of their legislation as have come down to us,
there are unmistakable traces of the equalising policy; the ius
sacrum was to a considerable extent stripped of its exclusive cha·
racter, and the law of procedure, as to which we have important
fragments, was settled upon a basis which gave justice a fair chance
