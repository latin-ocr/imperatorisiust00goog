EXCURSUS VI.

DOLUS, CULPA, AND CASUS.

Α 22222 to 2 contract or quasi-contract may commit a breach 01
its terms, express or implied, either intentionally or unintentionally.
Deliberate breach (dolus) always entailed liability-dolus semper
praestatur—which could not be evaded even by an explicit agreement
to the contrary: ‘Celsus putat non valere, si convenerit, ne dolus
praestetur: hoc enim bonae fidei iudicio contrarium est: et ita utimur’
Dig. 50. 17. 23: 01. Dig. 2. 24. 27. 3. Certain unintentional breaches
were treated in the same manner, whether consisting in acts 01 coru-
mission or 01 omission: via. those which arose from want 01 ordinary
care, from a carelessness so excessive that no ordinary man would
have been guilty 01 it: this is called culpa lata, and 102 it, even in
contractual and quasi-contractual relations, one is always answerable
no less than 102 dolus, or deliberate and intentional breach: ‘lata
culpa est nimia negligentia, id est, non intellegere quod omnes intelle·
gunt' Dig. 50. 16. 213. a: ib. 223. pr, ‘lata culpa plane dolo com·
parabitur' Dig. rr. 6. r.r ‘prope dolum est’ Dig. 17. r. 29. pr.,
‘dolum repraesentat' Dig. 47. 4. 1. 2, ‘dolus est' Dig. 50. 16. 226:
1⁶. 3. 31. ·

But ii a man's negligence or culpa is not 01 this extreme degree,
the question whether he is answerable 102 it is determined by reference
to two standards or criteria 01 carelulness, the one abstracto: abso-
lute, the other relative or concrete.

(r) In some relations aman is required to show what the Romans
call exacta diligentia, or the diligentia 01 2 bonus paterfamilias, a care-
lul, accurate, sound man 01 business, here he is answerable lor all
culpa, provided it could have been avoided by one more careiul than
himself : ‘culpa autern abest si omnia lacta sunt quae diligentissimus
quisque observaturus suisset' Dig. 19. 2. 257. Modem writers call
this culpa levis in abstracto: in the authorities it is usually called
culpa simply: when it is said that a manis answerable not only 102
dolus but 102 culpa as well, what is meant is that he is answerable 102
levis culpa: the liability 102 lata culpa, being universal, isimplied.
