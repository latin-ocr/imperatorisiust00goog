Tit 1.] DE IUSTITIA ET IURE. 91

laedere, suum cuique tribuere. Huius studii duae sunt4

positiones, publicum et privatum. publicum ius est, quod ad
statum rei Romanae spectat, privatum, quod ad singulorum ,
utilitatem pertinet. dicendum est igitur de iure privat0‚ quod
est tripertitum: collectum est enim ex naturalibus praeceptis
aut gentium aut civilibus.

may be, however, that Ulpian, lrom whom pr. and §j 1 and 3 of this
Title are taken, and in whose ‘Regulae‚’ Bk i, they stand in close con·
nection, meant j 3 to be an expansion or explanation of pr. ; by enounc-
ing, as the first precept os the law, a rule relating to oneself and not to
other persons, he intended to say, that although justice is what he defines
it to be in pr., it is not yet enough to injure no one, and to give every
man his due, in order to save onesell from collision with the law: the
law also punishes any unworthy conduct by which one’s own personality
is degraded.

j 4. Public law ‘in sacris, in sacerdotibus, in magistratibus consistit'
Dig. 1. 1. 1. 2. ln the Roman view it comprised two parts: (r) constitu·
tional law in its widest sense, i.e. the law which determines in whom the
sovereign power shall reside, how it shall be exerclsed‚ and to what
checks the persons among whom it may be distributed shall be subject
lt thus embraces all administrative law, which indeed under the later
Empire formed its largest portion ; see the account of Theodosius' Code
in the General Introduction, p. 62, supr. Another important portion of
it was the ius sacrum, even aiter Constantine had made Christianity the
national religion (2) Criminal law: privata delicta (torts) were distin·
guished from publica delicta or crimes : ‘publica crimina, quorum delatio
omnibus conceditur’ Cod. 9. 9. 30. pn, see Bk. iv. 18. 1. inf.

It is oi course impossible to draw a perlectly hard and sast line be·
tween public and private law, and this was for historical reasons par·
ticularly true ol Rome (General lntrod. p. 16 sq, supr.); many institutions
are from one point oi view regarded as publici, from another as privati
iuris; thus tutela, though discussed in the Institutes, was a munus pub·
licum, and so in Dig. 28. r. 3, it is said ‘testamenti factio publici iuris
est' Civil procedure, from the prominence with which it is treated in
Bk. iv, and also by Gaius, was apparently considered a part of private
law; but by many this is regarded as arbitrary and unjustifinble, on the
ground that rules of procedure are properly rules determining how the
powers ol certain officers (magistrates and judges) shall be exercised.

The division oi the whole body of law observed within the limits of
any given state into public and private, though as old as Aristotle (Rhet.
i. ι 3. 3), and adopted by the modern civilians no less than by the Roman
jurists, is severely criticised and rejected by Austin (jurisprudence,
lect. 44), who would make the socalled public law part ol the law ol
persons. This is scientifically correct ii we take law ol persons, as he
does, in a sense very different from that given to it by its originators:
