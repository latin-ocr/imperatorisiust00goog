his ples in defence. Thus the material nature of an exceptio is that
it is a plea of a countervailing right ; its form is that of a negative
condition of the condemnatio, introduced by the words ‘si non' or
an equivalent; and its place in the formula is between the Intentio
and the condemnatio. Asimple illustration is found in the exceptio
pacti (Gaius iv. 116); eg. Aulus owes Titius money, for which the
latter promises not to sue, and theu nevertheless brings his action;
· Aulus would repel him by the exceptio ‘si inter Aulum et Titium non
convenitne ea pecunia peteretur! The usual Roman classifications
of exceptiones are noticed in the text (Bk. iv. 13) and commentary; the
answer to the question, ln what classes of actions this peculiar rule
had the widest operation, depends on the character of the Intentio.
The more special and definite the Intentio, the more likely was it
that the defence would consist in the allegation ofa countervailing
right rather than ln a direct traverse of the plaintilfs claim. ln real

actions, accordingly, it was the rule that defences other than a simple ·

denial of the Intentio must be expressed in the formula. ln personal
actions a distinction must be drawn. In condictio the same rule
applied; but fn bonae fidei iudIcia the Intentio claimed only what the
defendant owed ex fide bona, so that any defence which alleged want

of good saith on the plaintifi's part was practically a comple traverse ·

of the latter's claim, and so need not be introduced into the formula
as an exceptio. This the Romans expressed iu the maxim ‘doli
exceptio bonae fidei iudiciis inest,·’ which may perhaps be expanded

into a general rule, that in bonae fidei actions defences by way of
⁸ countervailing right need not be alleged ln iure so far as they were
.grounded on equity and bona fides, but only where they were based
on the ius civile, oron rules of procedure ¹.

Sometimes the plaintiff could meet an exceptio by an answer of
tbe same kind; he did not deny its truth, but set up a second
couutervsiling right of his own-an exceptio to an exceptio. This
was called a replicatio and was inserted in the formula by the words
‘aut si,' or an equivalent And this kind of sparring between the
parties might lead further to a duplicatio, a triplicatio, and so on;
illustratious of which will be found in Gaius iv. rso-129.

Praescriptiones pro reo do not differ substantially from exceptiones.

In the earlier part of the formulary period many defeuces by way of '

countervailiug right were clothed ln a peculiar form, being placed at

¹ See ffeller, Civil Process ς ²5- In this respect actions with a formula in
factum concepta do not seem to haue bem on the nme footing with those which
were bonae fidei.
