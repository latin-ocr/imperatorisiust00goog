DE SOCIETATE·

Societatem coire solemus aut totorum bonorum, quam
Graeci specialiter κοινοπροξίαν appellant, aut unius alicuius
negotiationis, veluti mancipiorum emendorum vendendor-

ln locatio conductio rerum et operamm, if the hiring was for no
specifrc time, either party could terminate the contract by notice of the
length prescribed by local or commercial usage. lf the conductor rei
continued to use the thing, with the others assent, after the time agreed
upon had expireda new contract was understood to have been made
(relocatio tacita) ; if the res was agricultural land, for a year (Cod. 4. 65.
η 11); if anything else, and the original agreement was in writing, for
the term therein specified; is not, for the time during which the con·
ductor actually used the thing.

uit. XXV. Before distinguishing the different forms which a partner·
ship might assume, two limitations should be noticed which the contract
might not transgress. No person could even by express agreement
deprive himself of the right, noticed in ξ 4 inf, of withdrawing from a
partnership when he pleased3 in other words, there could be no societas
in aeternum ‘in societate nemo compelliturinvitus detineri’ Cod. 3. 37. 5.
Secondly, the purpose for which the contract was formed must he neither
unlawful nor immoral: ‘generaliter traditur, rerum inhonestarum nullam
esse societatem’ Dig.,17. 2. 57.

Α fuller classification of the species of partnership is given in Dig. 17.
2. 5, via:

(1) Societas omnium bonorum, in which all that previously belonged
to the socii in severalty becomes their joint property by the mere making
of the contract (see on Bk. ii. 1.4o supr.),as well as everything which any of
them may subsequently acquire : ‘in societate omnium bonorum omnes
res, quae coeuntium sunt, continuo communicantur, quia, licet specialiter
traditio nonlinterveniat, tacita tamen creditur intervenisse ; ea vero, quae
in nominibus sunt, manent in suo statu, sed actiones invicem praestari
debent’ Dig. 17. 2. 1-3. This rule does not hold in the remaining kinds
of societas. Debts contracted by one of the partners, whether before or
during the partnership, can be claimed ont of the joint property, Dig. ih.
27, which, however, is not liable for damages incurred ex delicto unless it
has to the knowledge of the partners been augmented from the proceeds
of the wrong, ib. 52. 18.

(2) Societas universorum quae ex quaestu veniunt, or ordinary com·
mercial partnership, which, in the absence of express agreement, was
presumed to be the transaction intended by the parties. Gains derived
from gift, legacy, or inheritance were not included under quaestus, Dig.

(3) Societas negotiationis alicuius, agreement for the joint conduct of
